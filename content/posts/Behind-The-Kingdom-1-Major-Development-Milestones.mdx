Hello, friends and Aesar from The Kingdom! This article marks the first time we’ll go into detail talking about everything that has happened behind the scenes on Aesor. We’re here to spill the beans on significant developments over the past 6 months and beyond and are happy to have you along for the ride. 

We have been hard at work building the applications and user experience behind closed doors. We’ve made significant progress and also learned a lot from our mistakes. Thankfully, we are very fortunate to be in a position where our community is not affected by these mishaps, so with our hard-learned processes in place, it’ll be smooth sailing into the future.

Our launch is right around the corner, and we will begin marketing in full force soon, but before we do so, we want to take a look at everything that happened so far, and showcase some of the major milestones achieved while creating the best possible experience for our future players.

### Expanding the Team

When we founded The Kingdom, it was just a small group of Citizens with a grand vision. But as the months have passed, and as that vision materialized, we have met many like-minded people who quickly found a position among our ranks, making immense contributions and accelerating our development to where it is today.

It’s been an amazing journey. We have come to realize it is very important to understand what our limitations were, right from the beginning, to make sure we find the right people to cover for our shortcomings, which is exactly why we became a team of 15 and counting! From valuable contributors to full-time professionals, we have many bases covered. We are very grateful for everything they have done so far- The Kingdom wouldn’t be the same without them!

### Massive Avatar Creator Improvements

The first impression when interacting with a new platform or application is extremely important. It’s the earliest chance we have to show what we’re all about, not only in presentation but also in potential functionality. The experience must be seamless, pleasant, and inherently functional right from the start to begin with the right foot forward.

This is exactly why our flagship product, the Avatar Creator, has received the majority of attention in this development stage. This application is the gateway into our ecosystem and is used to access many different functionalities within our platform, so we first made sure the user experience, design, and functionality are in top condition. Even now, we are still finding improvements to be made, and have been hard at work to implement them in a timely manner.

Here’s our progress thus far:

* Nearly 400 of the 500+ Avatar Traits have been redrawn according to a unified art direction for maximum visual consistency.
* Our 7th Race, the Gruul has been fully redesigned to be more distinctive and related to the world of Aesor.
* Created a surprise for the intro to the avatar creator that even our beta testers haven’t seen yet!
* Animations and transitions have been added to the application and user profiles.
* Added the ability to change the color of starter gear and added additional colors as rewards.
* Implemented variable item rarities.
* Full UI/UX Overhaul to be as user-friendly and intuitive as possible.
* Payment options for both credit cards and all popular cryptocurrencies with zero gas fees.
* Expanded login authentication options.
* Thanks to a recent partnership with RMRK, we have been implementing their NFT 2.0 lego technology to make the avatars even more versatile in the way they can be used and traded.

Even though this covers a lot of ground from a technical development standpoint, there will be a lot of surprises coming during the launch of our creator. We honestly can’t wait to see the reactions from our community to what has been built so far, it has been a long time coming, and we’re excited for the moment you get your hands on it!

### Art and Lore of The Kingdom

We have always felt most Web3 platforms hold back on making the experience more immersive, and native to their players. Something more familiar than this unknown technology with a lot of complex details. 

This is why everything surrounding The Kingdom has been envisioned to be completely in theme, with its own unique lore and identity, because we have always wanted interactions with our platform to feel like an experience, immersive in nature, with a lot of hidden details to discover. It becomes about leading the player into something familiar to them, so they can discover Web3 Gaming in a much more interesting, fun way. 

Understanding this, our lore team has done an incredible job in maintaining a steady pace with the lore development. We are nearing 1 Million words of unique lore relating to Aesor, with more being built every week, giving us limitless possibilities for experiences and expansion.  

The addition of Jarranna, our Art Lead, into the team, greatly expanded our ability to bring the wonders of Aesor to life. The immense amount of lore that supports The Kingdom creates unlimited potential and depth in our art. 

We have discovered our artistic identity, and have committed to this visual style for everything we do, creating an enchanting and consistent atmosphere across all of our features.

Here are some of the milestones reached by our art and lore teams: 

* A comprehensive Art Manual has been built for maximum visual consistency.
* Dozens of in-depth concept art relating to locations, NPCs, races, weapons, mythic items, and more.
* New Race Flags Designed and animated
* New hand-drawn animations for the NFTs and Profiles.
* Lore and Game Design have been working together to help fictionalize all systems and mechanics, keeping them true to the lore and theme of Aesor.
* An Aesor-themed novella has been outlined and drafting has commenced.
* An in-depth Aesor Wiki is nearing completion.

### A Website Facelift

The previous landing page didn’t quite convey the full scope, nor feel of The Kingdom, so we decided it was time for it to receive a complete overhaul. This process took a lot of planning and contributions from every department within the team to complete. We’re quite happy with how it turned out and feel it is ready to carry the message of The Kingdom forward to all of our new users as we grow.

### A Thriving Community

Over the course of the last months, we have maintained a regular schedule of weekly events and tournaments. From discovering the best Web3 games and playtesting closed betas to enjoying our favorite new and old Web2 games together, our community has had no shortage of gaming opportunities. This is important to make sure The Kingdom feels completely alive, not only in its development but also in direct involvement with the community.

Meanwhile, we have successfully formed a team of very talented players, who consistently place on top of the competitive charts for games like The Bornless! We want to congratulate them for their phenomenal performance thus far. They even managed to secure 1st place in this year’s largest Bornless event, which is great to see. 

We also established a Twitch channel, where our esports & gaming team streams their gaming sessions throughout the week. Additionally, we host live art and lore development streams with our friends Jarranna and TLP, the Art and Lore Leads from The Kingdom team. It is now possible to see the world of Aesor being conceived in real time!

All in all, there have been a lot of great developments in community-facing efforts. Here is a summary in bullet points for you to check if you’re in a hurry:

* Regular Weekly Tournaments and Game Events
* The Kingdom’s competitive teams have placed very high in competitive tournaments, and even 1st place in The Bornless’ biggest tournament.
* Twitch Channel has been created.
* Started doing Art and Lore streams where we concept the world of Aesor live. 

### Going Forward and Beyond

It has been a journey to get where we’re at right now, and we’re happy to have you around for everything that is to come very soon.
