#### A Quick Word Before We Dive Into The Primer

This article is written based on my personal research on the project, and over 60 hours of gameplay in the latest playtest from Gran Saga Unlimited.  I was one of only 812 players, out of 8,000 who reached level 30 over the course of this playtest.  I ran through most of the available content and even got to experience the incredibly difficult raid only a select few managed to complete in the brief period it was available.

This was by far one of the most polished titles I’ve ever experienced during all my time in Web3 gaming, and I will be telling you all about the game, my opinions, and what we can expect from it in the future, including news for the next chance to play, and how to get ready for it.

### An Intro to Gran Saga Unlimited

Gran Saga Unlimited is a MMORPG built by METAPIXEL, and will be utilizing the Aptos blockchain.  METAPIXEL itself is owned by NPIXEL, a Korean game developer that prides itself on becoming the fastest Korean game developer to reach unicorn status.  This was done off the back of Gran Saga, their original IP.   

Gran Saga Unlimited (GSU) is a completely new game but is based on the same IP,  sharing the same universe and some of the original characters.  It’s worth noting this is likely the first Web2 developer who is willing to bet their keystone IP on Web3.  While we’ve seen lots of news about other web2 developers dipping their toes into web3 development, none have had the guts to put popular IPs on the line for it.  

Because the development of GSU is being done by a web2 developer we don’t have the amount of information we’ve come to expect with a web3 game.  There are a lot of placeholders on the websites, teasers, and simply more information being held close to the chest by METAPIXEL.  

This is a title The Kingdom will definitely be revisiting in order to deliver more information once it’s available. We will also be playing the game, especially since our players who got access all had a very positive experience.
