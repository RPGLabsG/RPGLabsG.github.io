#### A Quick Word Before We Dive Into The Primer

This article is written based on my personal research on the project, and over 60 hours of gameplay in the latest playtest from Gran Saga Unlimited.  I was one of only 812 players, out of 8,000 who reached level 30 over the course of this playtest.  I ran through most of the available content and even got to experience the incredibly difficult raid only a select few managed to complete in the brief period it was available.

This was by far one of the most polished titles I’ve ever experienced during all my time in Web3 gaming, and I will be telling you all about the game, my opinions, and what we can expect from it in the future, including news for the next chance to play, and how to get ready for it.

### An Intro to Gran Saga Unlimited

Gran Saga Unlimited is a MMORPG built by METAPIXEL, and will be utilizing the Aptos blockchain.  METAPIXEL itself is owned by NPIXEL, a Korean game developer that prides itself on becoming the fastest Korean game developer to reach unicorn status.  This was done off the back of Gran Saga, their original IP.   

Gran Saga Unlimited (GSU) is a completely new game but is based on the same IP,  sharing the same universe and some of the original characters.  It’s worth noting this is likely the first Web2 developer who is willing to bet their keystone IP on Web3.  While we’ve seen lots of news about other web2 developers dipping their toes into web3 development, none have had the guts to put popular IPs on the line for it.  

Because the development of GSU is being done by a web2 developer we don’t have the amount of information we’ve come to expect with a web3 game.  There are a lot of placeholders on the websites, teasers, and simply more information being held close to the chest by METAPIXEL.  

This is a title The Kingdom will definitely be revisiting in order to deliver more information once it’s available. We will also be playing the game, especially since our players who got access all had a very positive experience.

### How to Get Started with GSU

The 2nd Community Playtest concluded on July 20th so currently the servers are closed.  This playtest was available to 8,000 players who received access through a variety of marketing campaigns, partnerships, and raffles.  The Kingdom was fortunate enough to get some spots through one of our Vanguards, Drow.  

Presently, there’s no information on the GSU website or Discord for the date of 3rd playtest but we do know there will be one, from a previous Medium article.  We also know there will be even more testers allowed in than the 2nd playtest.  

It’s our understanding the game will be free to play at launch, so if you’re interested in playing, we recommend keeping an eye on Metapixel’s socials and creating an Aptos wallet in preparation for the event. We are currently waiting for more info to take an even more comprehensive deep dive.

### ![](https://kingdom-tinacms-store.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/GSU3.png)&#xA;&#xA;The Gameplay Overview

First and foremost, this was hands down the most polished playtest of a Web3 game I’ve played, which was extremely refreshing to see.  Across ~40 hours of playtime, I experienced no game-breaking crashes or bugs, which already makes me quite optimistic for this game’s future.    If you’ve read game content from me before you’ll know, that type of praise doesn’t come often.

If you’ve played a 3rd person MMORPG, you will probably feel very comfortable jumping into Gran Saga Unlimited.  It checks all the standard checkboxes you’d expect from a game of this genre, so if I were to complain about something, it’d be this predictability.  Yes, it’s surprisingly well polished, and they are using blockchain technology, but the gameplay loop doesn’t take any risks by trying something new.  I was also completely lost concerning anything to do with the story and lore since it is a continuation of the Gran Saga IP, which I have not played prior.  I’d like to see some more story catch-up/filler, especially since Gran Saga saw its success in Korea, Japan, and China, so the Western player base is likely as lost as I was.  All in all, these are minor details that do not stop the game from being really enjoyable in the end. 

Onto the actual gameplay.  There are currently 5 classes, and each has 2 specializations, which are referred to as augmentations. Here’s a list of all classes, augmentations, and their roles:

**Warrior
DPS | Melee | Off-Tank**

* Warrior is melee-based and its augmentation is the Slayer. Besides DPS, it can also off-tank.
* The Warrior’s second augmentation was not available during this playtest. 

**Gunner
DPS | Ranged**

* The first augmentation is Assault, focused on single-target DPS, and able to deal damage at close range with shotguns and twin pistols.
* The second augmentation is Blaster, focused on AoE, and able to deal damage at long range with heavy weapons.

**Mage
DPS/CC | Ranged | Off-Healer**

* The first augmentation is the Pyromancer, which is all about DPS and AOE.
* The second augmentation is the Summoner, a DPS that has access to powerful minions and ally buffs.

**Elementalist**

**Healer | CC | Ranged**

* The first augmentation is the Priest, a healer augmentation with access to defensive buffs.
* The second augmentation is the Cryomancer, a DPS with access to useful CC in the form of slows and debuffs.

**Guardian**

**Tank | Melee **

* The first augmentation is the Centurion, a single-target-focused tank that is able to protect allies with shielding skills.
* The second augmentation is the Breaker, an AOE-focused tank that is able to disrupt enemies and debuff them.

The short answer is: in the current playtests, there is nothing on-chain for Gran Saga Unlimited.  However, there will be on-chain assets at the launch of the game, which will be supported by the Aptos blockchain.  

The 2nd Community Playtest gave us some insight into which in-game items will be NFTs.  Anything found in the game that could be “metashifted” aka moved in or out of an Aptos wallet will present as an NFT.  This included hair, skin color as well as head, chest, and leg clothing/armor which were all cosmetics.  However, the tooltips for these hint at the fact there will be additional in-game bonuses that aren’t cosmetic when wearing them, such as mounts which increase movement speed depending on rarity.  

METAPIXEL intends to build a full game ecosystem with the 10K Catcha NFT collection to be the “premiere membership” to their gaming services.  The Catcha site currently has only teaser information so we are unsure how it will affect GSU.  We do know that all testers will be part of the whitelist raffle and those that reached level 30, will receive Squeezies, which can be used to upgrade Catchas.  Lastly, all selected testers (this excludes access codes) will be receiving a mount NFT at full launch.  

I can’t help but wonder why they chose Aptos as their blockchain.  Ultimately, though, onboarding web2 gamers to web3 requires a certain amount of education regardless of the layer 1 a game is built on.  It has been clear for some time Ethereum isn’t viable for gaming, and ETH layer 2 solutions also add unnecessary complexity to onboarding.  So if METAPIXEL can capitalize on their IP and attract new players to blockchain technology, I’m honestly all for Aptos and its lower gas fees.

Currently, METAPIXEL is taking some very proactive steps to ensure onboarding is as easy as possible.  Most notably, METAPIXEL will be able to actually cover the gas fees for certain transactions, so a user could use the blockchain without needing the $APT token already present in their wallet.  Everything they are doing for onboarding is extensive enough to demand its own article.  If you’d like to dive in to find out more, then check out this [medium article they wrote about this subject](https://metapixelblog.medium.com/creating-seamless-onboarding-for-web3-913bb6ed0c34 "METAPIXEL Medium Article").\

### Gran Sage Unlimited's History and Future

NPIXEL announced its entrance to web3 less than a year ago, Nov. ‘22 by announcing METAPIXEL, GSU, and their partnership with Aptos.  Worth repeating that NPIXEL’s history even in web2 is short but extremely successful, reaching unicorn status the fastest of any Korean developer to date.  Since then they’ve shown off their progress on GSU in 2 community playtests.  They’ve also hosted a couple AMAs and community events/giveaways.  

In terms of announcements and information METAPIXEL is operating in a typical web2 fashion.  It’s not your usual web3 drip feed of sneak peeks and hype building towards a mint but rather just big chunks of info or things to do like the playtest recruitment.  This also means we don’t know as much about the project’s future.  According to their Medium page, the next opportunity to play will be the “Premiere Launch”, planned for Q4 ‘23.  Key details include a server only in Singapore, permanent progress that will transition to full launch, and no access restrictions (simply make an account and play).  Then it’s onwards into a full launch in Q4 ‘23 but more likely Q1 ‘24.

If you are interested in participating, you will need to follow their socials to stay on top of the project, or join our discord and watch for our announcements. We will be watching the project closely ourselves.

### ![](https://kingdom-tinacms-store.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/GSU6.jpg)&#xA;&#xA;The Final Word

We are optimistic about this game.  Currently, the biggest hurdles for GSU are going to be capturing the western market as the success of Gran Saga IP is concentrated in the east,  and of course onboarding web2 gamers to web3.  

But if we’ve learned one thing from the age of microtransactions and broken release pre-orders, gamers will put up with a lot as long as the game is good.  And it is.  \
