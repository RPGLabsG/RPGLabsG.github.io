Hello, Aesar! 

September unfolded as a month filled with developing narratives, artistic endeavors, and new strokes of creativity in the vivid realms of The Kingdom. Dive into a peek of our month & what we spent our time crafting, imagining, and devising.

## New Faces Amplifying Creativity

In September, we welcomed Jeff Treves and Aditya to our team, who have both quickly become pivotal parts of bringing our plans for Aesor to life. Jeff has ample professional production art experience and will be helping us “level up” our art, ensuring that all of our final pieces are at a higher level of quality than you have seen before. Aditya has come on board to help bring our Partner IP pieces from the concept stage to fully realized gear that Avatars will be able to equip in our Avatar Configurator.

## Animating Aesor

Jeff hit the ground running, redoing the animated flags that accompany our Avatars and polishing the dragon illustrations and hero images for the website. These revamped dragons and hero images, now in layered formats, will provide a more dynamic parallax effect on the website, enhancing the user’s journey through our digital platforms.

## Neo Tokyo Parter Gear

With triumphant efforts, Aditya has now completed all 10/10 male sets of NT armor pieces, and we're moving into a round of feedback before finalizing their female counterparts. Our commitment remains staunch in ensuring all our work, from concepts to finalized pieces, adheres to a high standard.

## Expanded Concept Art

With Jeff and Aditya on board, Jarranna has had more time to work on fleshing out the world of Aesor through concept art, focusing much of her attention on the Arkey lands in September. If you have been participating in our Discord giveaways, you’ve already had a chance to see some of this gorgeous art! The goal was not just to showcase and define their architectural style for the upcoming minigame but to portray the diverse landscapes of Aesor’s far north.

Another area of Aesor that was finally brought to the canvas was Marcry, the magical energy of Aesor. The visual representations of Marcry were crafted with intentional diversity, ensuring each type was not just a different color glow but had a shape and flow that resonated with the type of magic it holds and its underlying ethos. This visual representation not only sticks to our narrative but also helps in memorizing the extensive variety we have.

## Riddles & Rewards

September also meant further work on the riddles of Aesor, with the first leg going live, and the next two receiving some updates and polishing based on the decisions, and feedback from the community during the first. The art that accompanied the first riddle was created in order to offer aesthetic clues while also ensuring each visual piece portrayed the elegance and mystery of our worlds. Meanwhile, our team also produced community rewards and riddle-specific artwork, intertwining each piece with our narratives and shared adventures in The Kingdom.

## Building the Wiki

Our digital encyclopedia grew, and its MVP was released to our community in order to help them along their journey through the first of our riddles. There is much more on there than just information about Alric and the Ephyrans though, so if you want to get a taste of what is in store for Aesor, explore the wiki and see what you find!

Some of the major recent updates include:

* Development into History: Delving deeper into the roots of Ephyran.
* Laying Foundations: Initial explorations into the origins of Aesor and the details of its landscape were constructed.
* Navigational Aids: Refined map pins and conceptual work on map locations have been done so that every traveler within Aesor would find their way through our realms with ease.
* Homepage and page icon designs and art upgraded for a more immersive overall experience.
