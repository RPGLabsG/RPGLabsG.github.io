This article is the first of many “Game Updates” that you’ll be able to access on The Kingdom’s blog. We’ve been playing The Bornless since the beginning, and are proudly one of their top factions– so this article has been a long time coming. It feels great to finally have a project come far enough that it warrants an update like this!

We’ll be covering all the updates that have recently come out of Cathedral Studios, as well as some of what is coming in the future.

## The Bornless Moves to Steam

We’ll start with the biggest news, which you may have already heard, but that doesn’t make it any less exciting: The Bornless is now on Steam! This makes the game far more accessible to players, as it is the most prominent game platform on PC. The Epic Games Store is coming soon too.

With the migration to Steam, the devs also dropped an early access trailer that gained the attention of over 125K players who have wishlisted the game on Steam, putting it at the top of the upcoming free-to-play games category. I can’t say that I am too surprised by all the attention. This game has deserved it for a while but has been held back by only being available on lesser-known platforms for the other phases of the alpha.

The first Steam access weekend just finished up and the upcoming weekends of open access will be starting with Halloween weekend. You will need to apply for access to get a code for these open dates. However, the eventual open beta and full launch will, of course, be on Steam. You’ll be free to download and try the game yourself, no extra steps.

## Unreal Engine 5 is Here

While it’s not brand new to the upcoming Steam builds, it is worth mentioning again that the game was recently upgraded from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5. This decision added to the development time, but will allow Cathedral Studios to deliver the best game possible. In short, the visuals of the game are looking way better across the board, and the performance is improved in comparison.

## Botis, the Serpent of Dread

So how about actual gameplay? What's new? We’ll start with the biggest new pieces of content, which are the introduction of “Titan Mode”, and the debut of a new demon named Botis. Botis takes the shape of a gigantic snake and will be the only available demon to play for these playtests. 

The Titan mode is actually an asymmetric game mode where one demon faces off with four humans. For human players to win, they will have to traverse the map in order to find and destroy the five nests of Botis’s eggs. For Botis to win, he will have to ambush, grab, and throw all the humans into the cultists' temple. 

Oh, speaking of the temple, did I mention that there’s also a brand-new map? Players will not be clashing with Botis on Two Rivers, the previous map that hosts Orobos, but rather Mboi Tava.  Mboi Tava is a new map set in the overgrown jungle crossed with rivers that Botis can easily lurk in and travel through unseen.

The human players are able to escape the Cultists’ Temple in the center of the map, but only if another teammate opens a door for them. They will not be able to escape on their own, creating a situation where humans will have to use precious time to save teammates when it could be spent destroying eggs. Humans will also have to contend with AI knife-wielding cultists scattered across the map.

So far, this is just the wireframe for this mode. There are plans to include more secondary objectives, along with more ways for both players and Botis to interact in the future.

## The Circus is in Town and Brought New Black Magic

There is one more new map for us to take a look at. In this case, it is a new arena map called Sideshow, which will join Barn as the second playable 2v2 map. Sideshow is set in Zagan Land, giving us some sneak peeks into another future demon by that name.  Zagan the clown will unfortunately not be making an actual appearance in these October playtests. 

Sideshow is less open and less vertical than Barn.  It has a pretty traditional three-lane setup with various obstacles and weapons to pick up as you maneuver the map.  The spawns are offset, so I anticipate the “Haag’s Wares” lane is going to see the most action as duos try to take each other out.

While you’re at the carnival, why not try out some of the new black magic abilities? First off, Gehenna Bomb, Dae Shield, and Aecus Flare all got brand-new visuals but otherwise, are functionally the same.  

Apart from visual upgrades, there are several new additions to pick from as well.  The Aecus Rune is a placeable landmine that, like its counterpart, blinds opponents.  The Fulgur Rune is another placeable mine with 2 charges that do damage to players.  The last addition is the Primordial Shield, which the player holds up to cover most of their body.  The Primordial Shield does force you to stand still to use, but you can still fire over the top of it… and so can your opponents.  It will be interesting to see if these additions shake up the previous Corvus Eye dominant meta. With less room to maneuver on the Arena maps, I think the Aerus Flare might finally get its time to shine, pun intended.

## Home Sweet Safehouse

Finally, the last piece of new content but the first you’ll see is the safehouse. You'll notice that players now immediately load into the safehouse, where they can interact with various menus rather than having a traditional title screen and menu setup. The safe houses will eventually host online sessions in which you and your friends can all hang out.

From the safe house, you’ll be able to start matches, change cosmetics, and even practice your aim in the shooting range which is now directly attached rather than being a separately loaded map.  These safe houses are the base version and there will later be upgraded collectible versions.  Additionally, in the safehouse, players will be able to change their weapon skins, and their skill trees, and even read the deep dark lore of the Bornless universe.

## Future Updates

If you want to stay the most up-to-date on The Bornless, it is best to join The Kingdom's Discord where we give priority to any tournament announcements, run giveaways, and provide access codes when we have them for the game. In fact, we are planning an Arena tournament for this Halloween weekend playtest. 

As one of the most active factions, we will have plenty of codes but with over 125k players waiting for the game, spots will still be limited, so we will be rewarding our most active community members. We anticipate that as the community grows, the competition will be fierce, but we’re also confident our current sponsored players will continue their reign of sweeping first places in tournaments.

That's all the major news for the game. If you haven't done so already, make sure you follow their socials, wish list the game on Steam, and of course, always stay unholy!
