### Summary

Since the announcement of the First Aesar Founder Chests, our community has been using the quest system to its fullest, accumulating points to showcase their achievements, as well as to receive rewards. We’ve had hundreds of submissions, including some fantastic Fan Art, informational Twitter threads, and insightful feedback.

With so much interest in the quest system, we thought it would be worthwhile to go back to the drawing board and look for ways to improve the user experience so that we could make it as easy as possible for you to be rewarded for your time spent in The Kingdom.

In this update, we will be showing the changes to the interface, introducing new quests, and revealing how you can earn a Founders Chest for yourself.

### How to receive your very own First Aesar Founder Chest

The easiest, quickest way to earn your free Founder Chest right now is by completing quests.

This is because all players who place on the Top 50 of our leaderboards, will get a guaranteed chest! It is that simple. 

The best part? At the time of this post, it takes around 5 points to reach the Top 50. 

That’s one game night with The Kingdom, or simply interacting with a few of our tweets. There are many quick ways to secure your Top 50 spot. 

But beware, others may take over your spot if you don’t keep interacting with our quest system!

However, thanks to this new update, managing everything is now significantly easier. 

### An Improved Quest Interface

You are now easily able to see all quests, their description, and rewards within the submission page. Hyperlinks for accessibility are included.

### New Quests

We have included a few new quests, with many new ones coming this week. Get ready for many extra points!

* Lore Category & Quests
* Meme Creation Quest
* Project-Specific Quests

There will also be new quests every day this week, so make sure you pay attention to Discord and Twitter.

### How to use the Quest System

### Closing Thoughts

This is an exciting time to be taking part in our rewards. We want to reward you, the ones who come into The Kingdom as you as able, and interact with our systems, actively believing in our building. 

It is what keeps us going strong.

So make sure you go ahead and try some of our new quests and join Discord if you haven’t yet. We will be showing everyone what rewards they can expect from Season 0 very soon, and they may just be more than what you thought they would be. 

Stay tuned, Aesar.
