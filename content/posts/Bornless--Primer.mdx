### Quick Summary

The Bornless is a horror themed first person shooter being developed by Cathedral Studios, built on Unreal Engine 5 and set to become free to play at full launch on Steam and Epic Games.  

The game is currently in closed alpha, and has had various limited-time, playable alpha states for approximately a year, whilst featuring several large prize pool tournaments despite limited availability.  

Various game organizations are partnered with the title and featured as in-game guilds called “factions”.  These factions have been very active in the development feedback of the game and will continue to be through early access.  Lastly, the game features some very deep lore with multiple novellas, community written lore called “Mythos” and a wiki as well.  The full launch is expected to be in the later half of 2024 but there will be many opportunities to playtest the game for those interested in early access.

### Intro to The Bornless

The Bornless is an upcoming free-to-play, PvP first person shooter featuring distinct horror-themed lore, and a couple unique game modes. It’s being developed by Cathedral Studios, The Bornless being the studio’s first game/IP.

The game has digital collectibles that helped to crowd fund the development and will give holders limited edition cosmetics at full launch. It has been playable for about a year and recently transitioned into a new alpha phase.  The latest phase of early access moved the game over to Steam, with servers only being open for limited time slots on weekends for now.

With this newest phase, The Bornless is upgraded from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5, and will be receiving new game modes/maps by the end of the year, one being a new map for 2v2 deathmatch, and the other a "Titan" mode, which we will speak about later. The main gamemode currently is the “Ritual” mode, in which 4 teams of 2 people compete to be the last duo standing, while being hunted by the demon named Orobas at the same time.

The Bornless community has partnered factions through which players can get access to the game as well “Mythos” where community members can write lore, which can even become canon in the Bornless world.  Lastly, despite being in early access, The Bornless has started developing a robust esports scene with over $32K in prizes since the 1st tournament in Oct ‘22.

### How To Get Started

In order to know when the next playtest is available, it is best to join The Bornless discord or a partnered faction’s discord server (The Kingdom being one of them) to keep up to date.  Presently, the next four access weekends will be on Steam only.  They will require an access code which is only available to partnered factions.  We will have limited codes, and our most active members will get first dibs on them.  You can also try your luck signing up to the general Bornless form but as a fair warning, thousands have already signed up and spots are rather limited. 

After getting a code, this is how you get started:

1. Head over to the Steam app, and download the game.
2. Go through the installation process, and launch the game.
3. Create an account by launching the game, and clicking on “account” to sign up. It's also possible to quickly make an account by linking other common game platform accounts.
4.  You're good to go and start playing.

Factions are often organizing events to play, so it’s best to join them to ensure the lobbies are full.  If you are hosting a lobby with friends, you’ll need to add them as friends in-game to invite them into your private matchmaking lobby.  

Public matchmaking is in the game, but we recommend finding matches and using private matching since the number of playtesters are limited, you can sometimes be in queue for quite some time.

### The Gameplay Overview

Although we're here to talk about gameplay, we need to mention that the UE5 upgrade has made the game look amazing. They have even implemented a new lighting overhaul, so the game would probably be looking great even without the engine upgrade.

The limited access alpha phase of The Bornless has added two new game modes, a 2v2 arena mode, and the “Titan'' mode, which will also feature a new map.  We’ve seen some gameplay sneak peeks and know it’s going to be an asymmetric mode, with objectives to complete on both sides to get the win. This is also the first mode which allows players to control a demon called 'Botis', a massive snake that looks particularly terrifying when moving through water. 

The 2v2 arena isn’t considered a main mode, and doesn’t feature a demon at all (unless you count The Kingdom’s players).  It is also on new maps called Barn and Sideshow, which are very small as you’d expect for a 2v2 round-based mode.  Each team spawns with pistols and can pick up better guns and ammo around the arena.  The duo that eliminates the other wins the round with a reset between rounds, first to 3 rounds wins the whole match.  This mode is best for a quick game session and to work on your aim and/or try out the guns if you are new.  It’s fun and can be competitive but doesn't have a ton of depth to it, nor is it meant to, since again, no demon is present.

This brings us to the “Ritual” mode, or Orobas mode, which is played on the “Two Rivers” map.  The Orobas mode is a Battle Royale, Deathmatch, PvPvE mix of unholy hardcore gunplay.  The ultimate objective is to be the last duo of the 4 standing, with many different strategies on how to do just that.

Players start the match with a pistol, knife and choose 1 of 7 spells. The first 90 seconds of the match are the looting phase, where all chests and shops are available. For players to succeed in the match, they must loot as much incense as possible, and reach a shop to spend it on better guns and ammo, which will often be contested by other duos.  The next 4 phases of the match last 3 minutes. During each phase, there is 1 active shrine where players can summon Orobas to hunt other duos.  The 4 shrines each occupy a quarter of the map, the active shrine is random but cannot repeat.  

During each phase, an adjacent shop will be active and the chest in that quarter of the map will be lootable. The demon Orobas is entirely AI controlled and will primarily chase 1 duo on the map, attempting to melee them to death with his claws, which can be difficult to deal with for new players.  However, after learning Orobas' tricks, veteran players' main worry is all the noise he makes, since it gives away their presence to other teams on the hunt.   

Because the shrines and item shops scattered across the map are accessible only 1 at a time, players are forced to compete over resources, which replaces the need for an enclosing circle like most battle royales. After the 4 phases are done, comes the final, 5th phase, when the shrine in the catacombs at the center of the map becomes active. At this point, Orobas moves at double speed and hits twice as hard, meaning you can’t escape from him and will usually close out the match within a minute or two.  

The gunplay is relatively hardcore. All the guns have iron sights only and are capable of killing a player with a single magazine, including the starting pistol, there is friendly fire, no map, no minimap, and no visual highlights or indicators for the players. Currently, there are 3 power weapons, namely the double barrel shotgun, Kar98 and tommy gun.  There are at least 3 new guns we’ve seen sneak peaks of and will likely be added soon. There are also 8 characters, each is unique and the duos are in set pairs, so the players must remember which character is friendly for each match, since again, there are no indicators.  The knife has a quick swing which kills in 2 hits and a heavy running lunge that is a one shot. Lastly, players can revive teammates up to 3 times per match.  

Finally, we have tournaments and events.  The Bornless has a functional private lobby invite system and spectator feature throughout early access.  This has allowed a small but very active competitive community to form. There’s enough depth to the gameplay for different strategies and metas to have formed across various builds and events, despite not all planned features being implemented yet.  The factions are the primary organizers of these tournaments, and they are typically hosted on either Community Gaming or Blumint.  The Bornless team also does an excellent job combining all the events onto a single calendar in their discord so you don’t have to worry about missing anything.

### ![](<https://kingdom-tinacms-store.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Bornless 4.png>)&#xA;&#xA;The Tokens

There is currently only a single tokenized asset for The Bornless, which is The Bornless Collection 1, an NFT collection with a supply of only 666 on the Ethereum chain.  This mint occurred at the beginning of the project in Q4 ‘21 and as the game is growing in popularity this supply is looking to be quite low and very rare.  

The original roadmap was going to have 8 collections of the same supply, but those plans are likely shelved, since there’s been no news for another mint, and the whitepaper is currently being revamped. It's likely this is largely due to the pivot in the general web3 gaming market as well as overall crypto bear market. 

So what does the NFT collection provide a player? What we've been told so far is that those holders will have access to upgraded safe houses, which are effectively live menu and hang out for gaming organizations/friend groups and can be upgraded further using incense extracted from games. 

Furthermore, it's likely that holding this NFT will give you access to skins and seasonal battle passes to come. Initially, there were plans to have an incense token, but those are also likely shelved. We do know there could be cosmetics that will utilize blockchain technology in the future as there is a partnership with ImmutableX. It has been stated this will only happen if there is enough player demand though.

At this point in time, it is safest to consider them simply a collectors item with some cosmetic benefits.

### History and Future

The Bornless first appeared in October ‘21 and after a short marketing campaign, The Bornless Collection 1 minted on Dec. 1st 2021.  At that point in time there was no playable game, but in just over a year the project had developed very rapidly.  Cathedral Studios was founded with The Bornless being the first IP in development.  There was a closed pre-alpha test which was open only to lucky and active NFT holders and community members.  This ended with an 8 person live streamed tournament that had a $2,000 prize pool.  

The game moved into private alpha, which expanded the playerbase a bit, and brought in a ton of new content, as well as substantial changes.  Moving forward, The Bornless began, and continues to onboard “factions”, which are given access to the closed alpha that was hosted on Elixir.  These factions were able to participate in a 64 team invite only tournament with a $10,000 prize pool in October ‘22.  The Bornless team recently released a new whitepaper shortly after and announced they’d be moving the project to new platforms as the alpha testing continued.  

The team at Cathedral Studios announced a partnership with ImmutableX, and will likely be launching future (if any) NFTs/cosmetics on that platform rather than the ETH mainnet.  They also announced the “Order of Solomon”, a hub for all the partnered guilds and gaming organizations to cooperate and develop the community.  This includes support for tournaments, events and other content creation.  

The actual IP has some really deep lore, the story now up as a short book which can be found on their website.  In a recent vlog they actually announced they’ve been stealth working on a single player mode for the game, which will be exploring this lore in ways a multiplayer battle royale of course can not.  Additionally, there are now many “Mythos” lore pieces written and canonized by community members.  The Mythos creator program remains open for new participants as well.  

The same vlog gave us the first look at a “safe house”.  These are between-match bases that players will be able to deck out with cosmetics and upgrade skill trees that will help in matches.  The free-to-play version was the one being teased, and the NFT collection holders will have larger and higher utility safe houses.  

In terms of the gameplay itself, we know there’s at least 5 new guns being added soon, and while not confirmed, I imagine we will have different melee weapons coming at some point too.

We've also gotten a look at Bael, a gigantic spider, and Zagan, the clown demon, both joining the roster at a later date.  As the early access phase progresses, expect it to become less limited in spots with full launch of the game expected in late 2024.

### ![](<https://kingdom-tinacms-store.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Bornless 6.png>)&#xA;&#xA;The Final Word

The Bornless is a solid project making steady progress on a unique horror first person shooter that has done far more with a small indie team and budget than many of the most funded projects in gaming. The open access weekends are a great way to play, test the game and see for yourself as it is open to all. The kingdom will continue to support their growing esports scene as well and intends to continue to stay on the top of it.
