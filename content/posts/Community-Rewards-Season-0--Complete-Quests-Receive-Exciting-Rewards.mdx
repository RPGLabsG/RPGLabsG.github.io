We’re excited to announce the start of our Community Rewards Season 0, as well as the Pre-Launch version of our application!

Our Community Rewards “Questing” system is designed to help all of the adventurers who decide to join us on the journey to reach new heights.

Whether you’re a fresh face in the community, an OG who has been here from the start, or a long time lurker, everyone can participate and get rewarded for completing our quests. No need to purchase any passes, nor go through limited time offers. 

Right now, this is our Pre-Launch Season 0. Which will last from September 15th until October 23rd. 

Keep on reading to learn how you can make the most of our Community Rewards and what to expect out of our Pre-Launch Application.

### What are The Kingdom's Community Rewards?

A quest system designed to reward The Kingdom’s community members for doing what they do best, gaming & engaging with the rest of the community. It also rewards those who spread the word and make an effort to tell their friends and communities about what The Kingdom is doing. 

You’ll complete quests from our quest list, submit proof through a submission portal on our application, and be awarded points by TK Team Members for successful completion of quests. Each quest has a few simple guidelines and measures to ensure a fair playing ground, limiting the risk of foul play like botting, or other unfair advantages.

Tasks include attending events by The Kingdom, playing together with us, talking about us on social media, and a lot more. You can find the full list of quests in the graphics at the bottom of this document.

The points you earn will be added to your account and displayed on a public Season 0 leaderboard. At the end of the season, those with the most points will win!

We have some exciting rewards in store for you, such as a Steam Deck, Gift Cards, NFTs, and even exclusive gear and titles that can be utilized with your The Kingdom Avatar, which will be available to mint nearer the end of the season.

The gear and titles offered here will never be available any other time, so this is your chance to claim a piece of The Kingdom’s early history for yourself and leave your mark on Aesor & our leaderboards!\

## The Prizes You’re Playing For 

1. Partner Project NFTs (Chronoforge, Warriors of Aradena, The Bornless, and more)
2. Avatar Free Mint and Mint Discounts
3. Steam Gift Cards
4. Exclusive Gear & Titles

And of course, our grand prize: 1 Steam Deck\


We’ve set the prize pool up in such a way that everyone can win something at the end of the Season, but of course those who are at the top of the leaderboard will receive the best prizes. So don’t waste any time and get started playing today!

One of the core features we have built The Kingdom on is accessibility. We believe that the high barrier to entry of many NFT projects is detrimental to the space, especially when it comes to Web3 gaming.

We have kept this in mind when designing our reward system, ensuring that anyone who participates diligently and contributes to the success of the community will receive the discounts needed to be able to mint their Avatar at a much more accessible price point than the status quo in Web3.
