### Introduction

What comes to mind when someone mentions “The Metaverse?”

Perhaps you think it is this over-hyped, idealistic concept that modern companies have been struggling to implement in any kind of meaningful way. You wouldn’t necessarily be wrong, there is some truth to that.

However, there are also aspects of “The Metaverse" worth discussing and exploring even now, ideas that could actually happen, given some further development time and technological advancements.

Of course, maybe you already know this, in which case your mental image may be nothing short of a scene out of a movie like ReadyPlayerOne, where you can seamlessly shift between full and immersive worlds based on movies and games.

It is likely that once the metaverse reaches its full potential, the content will not simply be poured into just one platform, like Yuga’s Otherside, Decentraland, or The Sandbox. Instead, the final version of “The Metaverse” will be a network of interconnected games, where your avatar and in-game items will be fully transferable across many other platforms and games. They will interact with each other, forming a decentralized structure. 

It may sound surreal, or not quite possible, especially considering how protective people are with their IP.

But stick with me for a bit, and let’s explore this possibility for a moment.

### What is Interoperability?

In summary, Web3 interoperability refers to the ability of different blockchain networks and decentralized applications to interact and communicate with each other seamlessly. Interoperability itself is essential for the growth and success of Web3, as it enables developers to build more complex and sophisticated applications, and users to access a wider range of services and assets.

Just like most cutting-edge technology, it is experiencing growing pains and challenges. Issues like differences in protocols, consensus mechanisms, and governance models used by different blockchain networks, just to name a few. 

But in general, the crypto space is becoming more and more interconnected with each passing day. There are now so many Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchains and Layer-2’s, that shifting assets from one chain to the other is just a few clicks and a bridge away. 

Specific to 2023, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, BSC, and zkSync are becoming more popular, and the Total Value Locked (TVL) of their DeFi protocols is rising. This increasing interest naturally translates into more development, more available liquidity, friendlier user interfaces, and faster bridges; All welcome and necessary advancements for wider adoption of this technology.

This means the underlying structure for interoperability is growing stronger, providing an opportunity for easier development when it comes to integrating this tech into Web3 gaming. To put it simply, interoperability as it relates to Web3 Gaming, is something we can imagine as connecting portals between different metaverses, and the representation of the same items and avatars in multiple games. 

Imagine a world where you could use your items in many other games, and where the stats you leveled up in one game can, to some degree, transfer over to other digital worlds. Progress is universal and always meaningful, no matter the game you decide to play. The potential for unlimited replayability, if properly implemented, is very significant.

We will be exploring the many issues a concept like this has in today’s gaming scene, but first, we will talk about exactly why interoperability is such a significant advancement for gaming as we know it.

### The Case Favoring A Decentralized Future

Ownership of assets, interoperability, and blockchain go hand in hand. The main reason why blockchain makes the most sense for the future of the metaverse is because of its decentralized nature. Decentralization in this case means there is no central entity in control over the entire network.

Decentralization is necessary. There is just no other way to go about doing this. I will explain. 

If the metaverse is not decentralized, it is prone to attacks, corruption, and the hoarding of power and influence by one single entity. It would also have a single point of failure since the corporation running it could decide to pull the plug at any point or be brought down by Denial-of-Service attacks. 

This is another reason why digitally owned assets can be so useful in gaming. By having the in-game items represented as a token on a blockchain, it reinforces the notion of true ownership and allows holders to trade, transfer, or use these tokens, without the need for approval from third parties. They will not disappear just because the IP owner of that asset has ceased providing support or decided to remove them for more nefarious reasons.

It is all about directing power back to the player. Players win because they get to own a portion of their favorite games and get rewarded for it. Companies win because they can tap into shared player bases, make more revenue from transactions between players, and get to spearhead an entirely new way to play games.

One of the most interesting possibilities– and also most difficult to achieve– is allowing players to use their digital assets in many different games and platforms, their existence and use cases not depending on one specific metaverse (or even blockchain). If at any point the game gets shut down, an asset’s usefulness can be preserved, since it has utility in other games as well. This in turn creates a more resilient infrastructure, effectively strengthening and raising the value of these cross-platform assets.

This is mostly conceptual for now, as there are big challenges to overcome before any of this can become a reality.

### A Realist's Take Against Interoperability in Gaming

There are challenges that will need to be resolved before this transition can take place. The most apparent one is how to integrate assets from inherently different games, to make sure they remain balanced with respect to power levels. It’s important to avoid something being too overpowered. Otherwise, players will farm one game’s items in order to use in another, more difficult game.

For example, lightsabers do not work well in a medieval-style MMORPG setting (or rather, they work too well). Or flight in a game where everyone else is restricted to the ground. Some games use food to heal your character slowly, while other games provide potions that heal you instantly. Imagine being able to teleport all over the map by leveling up their sorcery stat in one game, while in another, you have to achieve interplanetary travel by building an expensive ship that has a built-in hyperspace chip.

You get the point, and the list goes on and on. 

Actually, this challenge is so massive, that we don't truly know if it can be resolved in a way that works long-term and “makes everyone happy.” Even so, let’s explore some hypothetical solutions.

One solution would be to create something akin to a standardized Metaverse. A massive world with a set of loose, but consistent and interconnected rules that developers could follow. This standard metaverse would be the platform a developer would choose, and develop a game for. 

Imagine having something like the ‘Ubisoftverse,’ and it would have 10 games that are all interconnected in their progress and assets. The downside would be that changing any rules or balancing in this standardized metaverse, would affect 10 games all at once, with potentially thousands of ramifications, so each change would need to be very carefully considered.

Another solution can be done through partnerships between developers, where each metaverse would discuss any integration before implementing anything.

By working out all the agreements, and having all the specifics and game rules in mind when they decide to enter a partnership, they can balance content around each other. This feels like the most likely option for the near future. 

But there is one more technical challenge in the implementation of all of this. If one game has the option to trade (or lose an item upon your character’s death) how do they make it “disappear” from all other games in which the owner is using that item? Or, in the case of trading, transfer it to another player. Since the nature of the blockchain in its current state is such that each transaction has to be approved (signed) by the wallet’s user, it is very hard to implement this in a manner that is seamless and fast. Let alone, implement it in a way so that the gas fee for transferring the token isn't higher than the value of the token itself. 

For these reasons, when we are talking about cross-game interoperability, what is likely going to occur is the most primitive, basic interconnectivity. This will likely be limited to PFPs from digital asset collections being represented in other digital landscapes as playable characters. Holders will be able to verify their ownership and then use that token on some other platform.

Another likely use case, which is already happening to some extent, is purely cosmetic and limited to skins. This elegantly dodges both challenges outlined above, since skins usually do not change the power levels of an item, and you also only sign and pay the transaction fee when buying or selling the asset that represents the skin. It is easy. By removing the need for stats and other behavior components of the item, developers simplify all the technical challenges associated with it.

### Conclusion

We are quite a few years away from the vision most people see when they say “The Metaverse.” However, some basic progress is being made, and we are seeing many different teams working on their own version of what they perceive cross-game interoperability to be. It also helps that the infrastructure between many Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains are developing at increased speed, providing ease of use and paving the way for cryptocurrency gaming to follow suit. 

There are also those who are completely reinventing the way games are built from the ground up, and trying to achieve interoperability across many games within their ecosystems. Notably, this can be seen from two of the biggest and most impactful gaming studios in Web3 currently, Gala Games and Vulcan Forged, who allow you to use their NFTs and fungible tokens in various games on their platforms. 

All that being said, for true interoperability to emerge, there would have to be some basic underlying issues with technology solved. It is safe to say we are not quite there yet and that the road ahead is filled with uncertainty. For players to interact with each other across different games in any meaningful way using items, characters, and land plots seems a bit unrealistic at this moment.
