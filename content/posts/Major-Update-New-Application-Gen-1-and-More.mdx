## A New Application UI

<video url="https://kingdom-tinacms-store.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/App Shots for Twitter.mp4" />

Our old design was suffering from growing pains, it quickly started becoming cluttered, clunky to navigate, and felt too cramped to add any new elements without compromising our user experience.

We have redesigned it from the ground-up, making it more streamlined and easy to navigate. All relevant sections are now separated into an horizontal tool bar right on the main screen after log in, allowing you to go to any profile area with less clicks.

There are a lot of Quality of Life changes and little details to see, keep reading to discover more about what we have built for you.

### A New Central Hub & Navigation Bar

See the latest offers for The Kingdom right on the main page, and easily access all parts of our application with a slick new horizontal navigation bar.

### New Ways to Easily Manage Your Avatars

It is now possible to see your entire Avatar and Gear collection in a single window.

\<Show Avatar Window here>

You can even swap gear between avatars with only 2 clicks!

\<Demonstration here>

### Optimize Your Savings At The Bank

The Aesorian Bank is now open, Aesar! Check out your daily generated silver, total silver, and even which Avatars are generating the most silver.

Re-rolls and Land are something we will be exploring further soon.

### Quests & Leaderboard Redesigns Coming Soon

It will be much easier for us to expand functionality and ease user experience through this design, and we can’t wait for you to try it out. Make sure to let us know what you think in our Discord.

Next up will be the quest system window and leaderboards. This is a system that is very used by our community, and we can’t wait to show you the new designs.

## Earn Limited-Time Bonuses With Your Generation 1 Avatars

Want to get ready for the free Neo Tokyo Chests, Aesar? You can now start Pre-Ordering your Generation 1 Avatars, only for a limited time!

We did not want to have our community plan their days around a very brief minting window. Those who are here, and are early deserve to get their Avatars in a relaxed, timely manner, and even be rewarded for believing in what we’re building with The Kingdom.

These Pre-Orders will be open for a limited time, you may not want to delay if you’re interested, Aesar.

### Pre-Order Bonuses

1 Avatar: 1 Normal Roro Chest

5 Avatars: 6 Normal Roro Chests

20 Avatars: 15 Normal Roro Chests + 1 Premium Roro Chest

50 Avatars: 15 Normal Roro Chests + 5 Premium Roro Chests

Roro Chests will include rewards such as valuable gear to equip your Avatars right away, Silver and even Re-Rolls.

### Brand-New Gear To Collect

These new Roro chests will include entirely new gear for your Avatars.

Have a sneak peek at what you can expect.

More information about these coming very soon. Stay tuned.

### We’re Just Getting Started

All of this is just the beginning. We have a lot to show in the upcoming weeks, including our free Neo Tokyo Chests!

We will be hosting events, showing sneak peeks, and even giveaways on our Discord, so make sure to join in and enable your notifications to stay on top of everything.

## Neo Tokyo Gear Chests

We will be releasing the new Neo Tokyo Chests very soon! They are a result of our partnership with Neo Tokyo, and are entirely inspired by their distinct design.

These limited-time chests will contain avatar gear with varying rarity, from common, all the way to Epic, with finalized cosmetic appearance you will be able to equip into your favorite avatars right away.

### Features:

* Limited-Time and Limited Supply Chests.
* 30 New Armor Pieces
* 15 New Weapons
* 2 Extremely Rare Legendary Sets

Much like our previous Founders Chest collection, we intend these chests to be whitelist-only.

It’s not a bad idea to pay attention to the Discord and keeping up with the new quests during our ongoing Series II.

### The 2 Legendary Sets

There will be two sets that will stand out amongst every other piece of gear currently in the Kingdom’s ecosystem, and we intend to give everyone a proper fighting chance to earn them, instead of sheer luck.

This is why we have introduced a guaranteed drop system for this collection.

To guarantee your chances to get 1 of the 2 Legendary Sets we have, all you have to do is collect and open 18 Neo Tokyo Chests.

After opening all the chests, you get an entire set air dropped into your account, ready to be equipped!

We will have a variety of ways to secure your whitelists for this exclusive drop, so stay tuned to our Twitter and Discord to learn more.

## Generation 1 Avatars Mint

We intend to open the mint for our new series of avatars very soon, to give a chance for new users to give their shiny new equipment a try and begin generating some silver.

More details on this mint’s details will become available very soon.

## Other Chests

We understand there are a lot of avatars out there right now, but not a lot of gear to equip them. Therefore, ways to increase their gear score are scarce and difficult to come across unless you’re lucky enough to find rare-equipment avatars on secondary.

There will be a series of permanent chests to help our players itemize further and begin creating their silver-optimized avatar empire. We are going all out with the contents of these, but they are not quite ready yet.

You’ll hear more about these in another time, Aesar.

## That’s all for now!

We’ve been preparing many different things ever since you last heard from us, and we’re still not quite yet done. There will be a lot to see during the next few weeks, and we look forward to having you around, Aesar!

Meanwhile, make sure to join our Discord if you haven’t yet, and keep your eyes peeled for notifications from our Twitter, we will be there, as always.
