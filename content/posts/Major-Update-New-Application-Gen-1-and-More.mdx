## A New Application UI

<video url="https://kingdom-tinacms-store.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/App Shots for Twitter.mp4" />

We are thrilled to announce the release of our new application! You can find it here: [https://app.the-kingdom.world/](https://app.the-kingdom.world/)\
\
Our old design was suffering from growing pains, becoming cluttered, and clunky to navigate, and felt too cramped to add any new elements without compromising our user experience.

We have redesigned it from the ground up, making it more streamlined and easy to navigate. All relevant sections are now separated into a horizontal toolbar right on the main screen after logging in, allowing you to go to any profile area with fewer clicks.

There are also many quality-of-life changes and little details to see, keep reading to discover more about what we have built for you.

### A New Central Hub & Navigation Bar

See the latest offers for The Kingdom right on the main page, and easily access all parts of our application with a slick new horizontal navigation bar.

Seeing your entire Avatar and Gear collection in a single window is now possible.

You can even swap gear between avatars with only 2 clicks!

### Optimize Your Savings At The Bank

The Aesorian Bank is now open, Aesar! Check out your daily generated silver, total silver, and even which Avatars are generating the most silver.

Re-rolls and Land are something we will be exploring further soon.

### Quests & Leaderboard Redesigns Coming Soon

It will be much easier for us to expand functionality and ease user experience through this design, and we can’t wait for you to try it out. Make sure to let us know what you think in our Discord.

Next up will be the quest system window and leaderboards. This system is one of the most important in our community, and we can’t wait to show you the new designs.

## Earn Limited-Time Bonuses With Your Generation 1 Avatars

Want to get ready for the free Neo Tokyo Chests, Aesar? You can now start Pre-Ordering your Generation 1 Avatars, only for a limited time!

We did not want to have our community plan their days around a very brief minting window. Those who are here, and are early deserve to get their Avatars in a relaxed, timely manner, and even be rewarded for believing in what we’re building with The Kingdom.

These Pre-Orders will be open for a limited time, you may not want to delay if you’re interested, Aesar.

### Pre-Order Bonuses

* 1 Avatar: 1 Normal Roro Chest
* 5 Avatars: 6 Normal Roro Chests
* 20 Avatars: 15 Normal Roro Chests + 1 Premium Roro Chest
* 50 Avatars: 15 Normal Roro Chests + 5 Premium Roro Chests

Roro Chests can include rewards such as valuable gear to equip your Avatars, Silver, and even Re-Rolls.

### Brand-New Gear To Collect

These new Roro chests will include entirely new gear for your Avatars.

Have a sneak peek at what you can expect.
