Dear Aesar,

As the golden leaves of October marked a change in the seasons, The Kingdom experienced its own dynamic transformation. If you have tuned into our recent community spaces, then you know we have made some transformative additions to our launch strategy. We’ll touch on some of those changes in this update, as well as some of the other progress that The Kingdom’s team made in October.

Playing games as a community, hosting competitive gaming events, and meticulous launch preparations dominated our month. These aren't just events or tasks for us. They represent a dedication, a journey we've embarked upon together, a testament to our team's relentless effort and the community's unwavering support. Today, we invite you to join us in revisiting these pivotal moments, understanding not just the 'how', but the 'why' behind our endeavors.

## Community and Gaming

Avatar TCG Championship Series: Concluded

October Saw the conclusion of our 3-part TCG Tournament series, where avid gamers battled it out in Gods Unchained, Parallel, and Cross the Ages. Winners each received the largest bounties of a $1,200 total prize pool.

We hold these tournaments for a few reasons– beyond simply enjoying the thrill of competitive gaming. 

Our application layer will act as the connective tissue between gamers, games, and gaming communities, and one important aspect of that relationship is community events, which often take the form of tournaments. Hosting these events allows us to start building the foundations for what’s to come while providing you with opportunities to play your favorite games and win prizes.

Twitch Streams

Join us a few nights a week on Twitch as our gaming team explores some of the best that Web2 and Web3 have to offer. There’s no replacement for doing your own research, but at least you can be sure that our streamers have done theirs. In our opinion, there is no better way to learn about a new game or take your current gameplay to the next level, than dropping in on one of our streams.

Twitch streams are also a great way to get to know the community better, and it’s always a fun time dropping into Ozone’s stream to spend your chat points on treats for his dogs!

Play-Tests

The community came together to test a variety of games in October, including ChronoForge, The Bornless, and Golden Tides. If you have never helped playtest a game, we recommend trying it out! It is a great way to see “under the hood” and learn about what it takes to make a great game and can be very beneficial for the developers as well. Besides those benefits, we always end up having a great time, no matter what game we are playing!

Riddles

The community puzzled their way through the first arc of our 3-part riddle story, the second part of which will take place in November! You can read all about the thought process behind our lore-based riddles and the impact that you can have on the world of Aesor by reading our Riddles Blog Post, here:

## Marketing

Pitch Deck & Outreach

October saw the complete overhaul of our pitch deck into the outreach-ready version which we have already begun circulating to potential partners. Even this early in the outreach process we have seen some very promising responses, and will soon have no shortage of exciting announcements for you on the partnership front. So far we have secured partnerships with NeoTokyo, Community Gaming, RMRK, Analog, and our first cohort of strategic game partners such as The Bornless, Aradena and Chronoforge. 

As far as our partnership strategy is concerned, we want to focus on cross-pollinating IP from the best brands in the space. Neo Tokyo, the community that has provided much of The Kingdom’s top talent, was the first IP that we explored this relationship with, the ongoing results of which you can see below.

If you want a taste of what we have prepared, you can find the current version of the pitch deck in the announcement channel of our Discord! Drop into Tavern Chat and say hi while you are there!

We’d like to give a shout-out to our Marketing Lead, Alex, who put on his secret “Design-Lead” hat to create all of the custom borders and frames that you see in the deck. 

Founder’s Chests

We won’t get into this in too much detail here, as we are saving the most exciting news for upcoming announcements, but we can provide a little alpha to all of you who are reading this! 

In the coming weeks, we will be announcing a free mint of Founders Chests, which contain a variety of weapons that can be used in the Avatar Configurator, and the eventual digital TTRPG.

The best way to secure a whitelist spot will be to make sure you are near the top of the Community Rewards Leaderboard. So if you want exclusive weapons, make sure you have signed up and are submitting your quests!

Quest Submission Portal: [https://start.the-kingdom.world/forms/contest/submit/](https://start.the-kingdom.world/forms/contest/submit/) 

The Founder’s Chest collection has been designed to help drive user acquisition and will be bolstered by our user retention systems that you have already helped us test, such as the Riddle Story, or the upcoming Race Quiz. We are confident that with these systems in place, and with the sheer amount of usability that we offer on Day 1, you’ll be able to watch The Kingdom’s community quickly grow and flourish.

## Art and Lore

The Creative Team Grows

Our Creative department has been busier than ever and has grown to accommodate the increased workload and scope. First, Jeff Treves has come on board as our Animation Lead and Production Artist and is helping us level up our art across the board. Then, Aditya joined the team to help increase our output of production-ready art, especially when it comes to things like weapons and armor for the Avatars, or gear for our cross-IP partnerships. 

Wiki of Aesor

Our Wiki has grown significantly in recent weeks as the Lore Team continues to add to the already massive collection of information about the world of Aesor. Most of the recent additions have been geared at providing further background information that pertains to the Riddle Story, as well as the factions that you will choose when you create your Avatar.

You can check it out here: [https://www.worldanvil.com/w/aesor-themadkingloktra](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/aesor-themadkingloktra) 

The world of Aesor is something that we feel sets The Kingdom apart from many of the other games or gaming communities in the Web3 space. We have spent nearly two years fleshing out the world in extreme detail, and the wiki represents the first opportunity for you to truly start peeling back the layers of our world and learning about the many intricacies of its magical landscapes and inhabitants.

Community TTRPG

In October we resumed our Discord “Aesor D\&D” sessions, during which anyone in our community is welcome to attend and create a character to explore the world of Aesor with! The Lost Prince is a DM with decades of experience, and he was a fundamental part of the team that created the world of Aesor, so he is the perfect guide to introduce you to its many wonders and mysteries.

If you haven’t played yet, we encourage you to try it out. Who knows, perhaps your participation and feedback will affect the world of Aesor in ways you can’t even currently imagine! After all, world-building and role-playing are the forces that brought much of The Kingdom’s team together in the first place!

Breathing Life Into Aesor

At the end of the day, the Art Team spent most of October doing what they do best: bringing the world of Aesor to life before our very eyes. This process usually starts with our Creative Director, Jarranna, who creates the concept art and art manuals that guide the rest of the team. In October, much of the focus was on the northern lands of the Arkey in the Whitehail Peaks, though we also explored the Founders Chests, new weapons, locations or characters from the riddles, and even Balrose himself.

From there, Jeff and Aditya bring the concepts to production-ready quality for use in the application, where you will soon be able to experience some of the new art and animations that they have been working on for the first time!

## Game & Application Development

Overall, the development of both the application and the game is in full swing, with roadmaps set and specifications written. We can’t go into the full extent of what we have been working on in this update, but some of the highlights can be found in the sections below.

MVP Demo

Our Unity Developer and the rest of the Game Design team have been hard at work creating a demo video of our digital TTRPG, to be able to demonstrate to you in a clear way exactly what our vision for the game is. 

While those of us who spend our weeks creating game design documents and debating the specifics of game mechanics know our vision, it is not always an easy task to clearly explain that vision to the community, which is why we are so interested in taking the time to create this demonstration. 

Work on this video is still underway, but we intend for it to be in your hands before next month’s Behind The Kingomd Update. Expect animations, dialogue, dice rolling, and all the other things you love in a TTRPG experience!

Production Application Improvements

The Development of the application in October was largely focused on further improving the user experience, such as a new flow to make creating and minting multiple Avatars at once easier. Our engineering team also put some finishing touches on the Avatar contract when it comes to implementing the RMRK Modular NFT standards, which you can learn more about [here](https://blog.the-kingdom.world/posts/Partnership-Announcement-RMRK). Furthermore, they developed the back-end programming for the Founder’s Chests, which we mentioned earlier in the update.

Some other updates to the application include improvements to the NFTs themselves, setting up the automation for the fantasy race quiz, adding a pre-mint overview page, working on the start menu, finalizing logic for the “player vault”, adding logic to support new helmet designs, adding a new animated character selection screen, and more.

When we finally open the doors to our application and the Avatar Configurator, we want to ensure that we can stand by its quality, which we hope will set us apart from the competition. The way you will experience these first steps into the world of Aesor is extremely important to us, so while our marketing and outreach efforts are slowly rolled out, we have been endlessly refining our product offerings with you in mind.
