## What is Play-To-Earn?

The concept of "Play-To-Earn" (P2E) has gained popularity in the world of blockchain-based games, to a point where both terms often refer to the same thing: Web3 Games. 

The idea behind P2E is, in its essence, very basic. It simply indicates players can earn money (often in the form of cryptocurrency) by playing games, and completing various in-game activities. Most big P2E games - which are at the top today, also have ways of earning by playing them, but usually the developers or gaming studios behind them do not favour or outright ban any “real world trading”.  In this case, players usually find (often unreliable and scammy) third party websites, where most of the accounts, in-game items or land plots are traded over the counter (OTC).  

Within Web3 however, trading items for real money is instead welcomed, integrated in the gameplay itself, and more often than not put at the forefront, mentioned on every corner while marketing the game. P2E has become especially popular with the rise of games such as Axie Infinity, The Sandbox, and Splinterlands. These games managed to attract a large player base and made early investors as well as their creators insanely rich. 

However, as the P2E model has gained popularity, it has also faced criticism for its potential to fall prey to “ponzinomics”(When early adopters receive all the profits and benefits, whilst newcomers risk having losses when the older users decide to exit).

Despite the initial hype, the P2E model has mostly failed to deliver on its promises for many games. The model was destined to fail due to several inherent flaws in its design, which we will explore in this article. To better understand the reasons for its failure, let's first spend a few words on how it was set up in the first place.

## How It Works

More often than not, P2E games are designed using a dual token model. The first one is usually always on-chain, while the second one may not be. Examples include Thetan Arena with their THG and THC tokens, Axie Infinity with their $AXS and $SLP tokens, Aavegotchi with their $GHST, and four other ERC-20 tokens knows as Gotchus Alchemica. There are many other examples.  

The main token is used as a governance token, which is used to influence the direction of the project. It is usually held by investors, and rarely by players. The more governance tokens are held, the more “voting” power an investor gets in their DAO on-chain. Supply is often limited. Usually, it is sold through presale rounds and other launchpads in the form of IDOs (Initial Dex Offerings), and can often be staked to produce high APY. 

The other token is separate, used for in-game trading as an exchange currency you can use within the game to buy avatars, land plots, items or skins for items. This one often has an uncapped supply. Players earn it for completing quests, selling resources, harvesting taxes on their land, or purchasing it with microtransactions. 

These (fungible) crypto tokens often have ties to NFTs as well. Most games use other in-game items, land plots on which people build their digital homes, and even the playable characters and avatars as NFTs. These non-fungible tokens can also be traded back and forth. It is not uncommon to see all of these three tokens interlocked in a dynamic where the in-game currency with uncapped supply is “burned” to create other in-game items or new characters, which often in turn yield more of the tokens. 

Perhaps you can already see the underlying issues emerging.

## Why Most P2E Games Fell apart

On one side, we have a token that is being devalued daily by an endless loop of printing new tokens within the game. On the other, NFTs getting minted at higher and higher rates. To top it off, a governance token with capped supply used for voting. This is terrible design for long term sustainability, since the growth of the governance token is dependent on the value of the in-game token, used to reward participating players. 

It creates a negative cycle, which only works when new players are joining the game and creating buying pressure. Once the player base stops expanding, it is game over, making this resemble a Ponzi scheme.

This may be the biggest challenge the current P2E model faces - the fact it relies so much on the recruitment of new players to sustain its economy. Furthermore, this “death spiral” is often sped up by game design which prioritizes profits instead of fun and engaging gameplay. 

In regular games, it is already very difficult to create a sustainable in-game economy able to last years, let alone decades. Quite simply, It becomes near impossible when the main goal is to profit from the start. 

Even today, many P2E Web3 games are built with this unsustainable model. It may work smoothly for a few weeks, sometimes months, but prices inevitably begin to decline after a while. This is when only game creators, early investors and a small fraction of early players becomes the only ones to profit from the new players entering the ecosystem. The ones who arrive during this time risk becoming ‘exit liquidity’ (The funds they insert into the ecosystem are used by older players to take profits and exit the ecosystem). This is a really common pattern which reflects a ponzi scheme, and has occurred with many P2E games in the past. Thus, the space coined the term “ponzinomics.”

This practice creates a toxic dynamic where “players” do not actually play the game for its own sake, or because it is fun, but rather to “grind” it as a full time job. When all economic value is extracted, the whole game economy begins declining. First slowly, then suddenly.

If the core player base is not interested in playing a game because it is fun, then there are no reasons to come back after all of its economic value is gone. To add to the pile, most of these games were based on hype and speculation, and their marketing heavily focused on the promise of future potential, neglecting their current state.

## Other Challenges With the P2E Model

In its current state, web3 gaming does not have any real ways of holding game developers accountable. The space is mostly unregulated, so players and investors have to rely on trust. 

We give project developers our money and essentially gamble it on the promises they claimed to deliver, putting our trust into their team or past successes. Growth is faster in the beginning since not only players, but also speculators are drawn towards the game, usually thanks to hype and promises. This phenomenon created a bubble back in 2021 and 2022, where prices of many games skyrocketed based on hype and speculation, and not as much based on true and tested gaming fundamentals. The potential of quick gains was leveraged to the maximum.

This brings up the fact the traditional P2E model has reliance on speculative value. Many of these games' tokens have little value beyond their use within the game. This means the token’s worth is driven by speculation rather than utility, making them susceptible to sudden, and significant fluctuations. This is a perfect example of how the crypto market is famously volatile. 

Thanks to this volatility, these games attract people who have a high risk tolerance, instead of players and investors who would like to build a sustainable and predictable income stream from the game.

## High Barriers of Entry

In addition to the potential for Ponzinomics and speculative value, P2E games often have a steep learning curve, making the barriers of entry even higher. Players need to invest significant time and money to understand and participate in the game's economy. This makes it difficult for new players to understand, limiting the game's potential growth. It is not rare to see basic NFTs which are needed to participate in a game. Examples of this include in-game characters and land plots being sold for thousands of dollars. This is just not an option for many people. To some degree, however, this issue is being solved by scholarships, lending platforms and web3 gaming guilds, who make these assets far more accessible. 

Lastly, P2E games often lack transparency and clarity around their often undoxxed teams, future plans and tokenomics. It usually takes hours of research to fully understand how all the assets within the game’s ecosystem relate to each other. This can create further confusion and trust issues for players. 

## The (bright?) Future of P2E. 

Admittedly, the current state of P2E is not the most exciting. Understandably so, since most holders are down 90% or more on their investments. The dream of “making it” turned out to be an empty promise which left many people disillusioned with the space. Most left and probably have no intention of coming back anytime soon. It has gotten to a point where people even grew some sort of aversion to the web3 buzz words themselves. This is why many companies and projects that are still around are shifting their words from NFTs to “digital collectibles,” the metaverse” to “....” and the concept of “web3 gaming” is all but scrapped from many founder’s vocabularies. 

However, this does not mean the whole idea is not a good one. We just haven't figured out a way to make it work yet. Players certainly can profit from games and it is very likely going to be a serious job in the future. 

Other massively multiplayer games have proven that a healthy secondary market is possible and essential for a game's community. Some MMOs supplement player income by providing in-game activities (Entropia and Eve Online). Runescape and World Of Warcraft also have thriving and sustainable economies, even though they face challenges of bot farms and prohibited real world trading. But unlike P2E, these games offer free-to-play entertainment with avenues for financial compensation for players that are either better at the game than others, or are willing to put in more time. They don't create artificial markets with high buy-in costs or depend on promises of future releases to keep their community engaged. Yes, this model can work, but it will likely not be as lucrative and hyped as people think.

There are two things that need to happen for P2E to work. And they are in theory relatively simple to understand, if not implement. Firstly, gaming studios have to put the game first, and short term profits second. Simply put, the game has to be fun and engaging and there aren't many of those around in the P2E space currently. Secondly, the underlying blockchain technology underneath the game has to become invisible. Can you imagine having to sign transactions for every trade, or pay a gas fee for picking up loot from monsters? 

It is very likely that when web3 gaming hits its full potential and the true “mainstream adoption” happens, that the games with blockchain integrations will be indistinguishable from the current web2 games created.
