### Weekly Builder’s Log Intro

As we mentioned in the [introductory post to our blog](https://blog.the-kingdom.world/posts/Getting-into-Web3-Gaming-with-The-Kingdoms-Blog), we will be keeping the community up to date with the building going on behind the scenes through regular posts, both in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/thekingdomworld), and here on the blog.

Last week we brought you up to date on what we have been [working on these past 6 months](https://blog.the-kingdom.world/posts/Behind-The-Kingdom-1-Major-Development-Milestones). Now we will begin our regular schedule, which means rotating through our 3 main product teams, diving into one each week:

* Creative Team: Art, Design, and Lore
* Front of House Team: Community, Gaming, and Marketing
* Back of House Team: Engineering and Game Design

### Creative Team Summary

As we gear up for Avatar Configurator launch, the Creative Team has been spending most of their time putting the final polishes on all the great things we have planned for the community. This means enhancing the NFT design and art, adding some flair to the onboarding process, and preparing fun ways for us to share our vast lore with you.

Furthermore, we have expanded the art team, and they are now continuing to flesh out the world of Aesor through concept art, as well as crafting stories and lore-explanations for our Social RPG.

### Creative Team Deep-Dive

#### Design

* Worked on the NFTs, improving their general design and introducing innovative features such as tool-tips and the ability to navigate through different screens within the NFT window.
* Optimized the Avatar Configurator UI.
* Created additional screens for the Avatar Configurator to support our RMRK NFT 2.0 technology, especially when it comes to player vaults and our drag-and-drop equipping logic.
* Crafted a greatly improved template for our pitch deck to be used in securing new partnerships and opportunities for our community.

#### Art

* Developed a new onboarding experience for the Avatar Configurator that will make creating your Avatar much more immersive.
* Conducted final adjustments on the NFT traits, ensuring they are consistent from both a lore & art perspective. 
* Created further variations to the gear that will be available during our launch as incentives and rewards, delivering maximum customizability.
* Began the process of expanding the art team so that we are better positioned for our next phase of development (we’re going to need a lot of art). 

#### Lore

* A major highlight was the development of our Aesor Wiki– a comprehensive guide to the rich history of Aesor (minus a couple of important secrets, of course).
* Worked closely with the game design team to ensure all elements of the game line up with the world they have created.
* Crafted outlines for the “season”-based framework of our Social RPG, as well as engaging stories for our players to explore, on a local, continental, and full-world scale. 
* Completed the lore-components of the community initiatives that we will introduce as we ramp up our efforts leading up to launch.

### Closing Thoughts

To our community: your enthusiasm is what propels us forward. Every piece of lore we craft, every artwork we create, and every narrative we design, is intended to create an immersive and dynamic experience for you. With Aesor, we strive to provide for you a world where every decision matters, every detail counts, and where you are at the center of it all. Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey so far, we are only getting started!
