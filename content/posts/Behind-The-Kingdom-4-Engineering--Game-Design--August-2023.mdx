### Summary

By the time you are reading this, the pre-launch version of our application is live, along with the Community Rewards Quests, and there is more soon on the way! If you haven’t, you can sign up for an account [here](https://start.the-kingdom.world/). This is all thanks to the hard work of the Engineering team, who are able to translate the ideas of The Kingdom into usable, quality products.

Game Design & Development has also ramped up, and will only continue to become a larger focus as we move past our initial launch period and can focus our full efforts on it. We’re now laying the groundwork that will allow the full team to turn their attention to game development once we have launched the Avatar Configurator in October.

### Engineering

* Planned out a revised product roadmap to take us through our launch, including the Avatar Configurator, episodic riddle stories, Community Rewards, and more. The goal with all of these is to provide an immersive and enduring experience for our community, and to enable you to be rewarded for your time spent in The Kingdom. Here is a deeper dive into each of these initiatives:
* Community Rewards Quests: Complete quests that involve everything from gaming with The Kingdom to helping spread our reach on social media, and gain points on our leaderboard for prizes at the end of the season.
* Riddle Stories: Explore the world of Aesor through three episodic riddle stories. You’ll be able to solve puzzles, earn exclusive cosmetic rewards, Community Rewards points, and even shape the future of Aesor with the decisions you make along the way.
* Fantasy Race Quiz: There are many different races on Aesor, take our quiz to discover which of Aesors’ fantasy races is most suited to be your first Avatar.
* Began working closely with RMRK’s Developers to plan the details of the integration of the RMRK NFT 2.0 legos into our smart contracts. This will enable us to use tech such as drag & drop equippable NFTs, and nested soulbound tokens, functionality that provides a better and more familiar user experience for our community.
* Devised the framework for the multi-stage release of our application, as we will have a lot to roll out over September & October. With a wave of different initiatives all releasing at different times, it is important that our community has a seamless experience throughout our launch. This means creating multiple versions of our production website to accommodate these releases.

### Game Design

* Began working in earnest on the MVP of our Social RPG, with the goal of creating a demo for the community to help share our vision of how we expect the game to look and function. We don’t want to show our hand too soon, but we are excited to get your eyes on it as soon as we feel comfortable with the quality.
* Most of the actual development work has been focused on creating processes that allow even non-technical team members to contribute to the game. An example of this is an easy-to-use city creation interface. This greatly increases resources as it allows team members who can't code to contribute to world development.
* The crafting system has been refined and is now in the queue for development. We'll start on this after we have achieved our next goals in the realm of the world map & user interface. We have decided to implement a more dynamic and puzzle-based crafting system than is present in most RPGs, adding a level of depth, fun, and replayability to an essential part of our gameplay.
* Both the Game Design and the Engineering teams have been working together and independently to devise the best methods for including AI in gameplay and user experience. This involves everything from Unity plug-ins to designing our own head & model system for our living world.

### Closing Thoughts

As you can see, development is in full swing here at The Kingdom, and now it is finally time for us to stand by the quality of our products, and the experiences that we have planned for our community. By fusing cutting edge technology and expansive worldbuilding, we plan to achieve our vision of a sustainable and thriving gaming community and Social RPG. Thank you for coming along on this journey with us, we’re only getting started!
