## The State of The Kingdom

*The TL;DR is we are not just aiming high but preparing for world domination.*

This is a critical year for RPG Labs and our flagship brand, The Kingdom. To be clear, we have never been more confident that we’ll be able to succeed in bringing our vision for Aesor to life.

We know things look slow, but we haven’t slowed down in the slightest. Soon, you’ll wonder how we achieved so much in so little time.

### Right Place, Right Time

We have a significant headstart in a genre whose growth is poised to explode: the least saturated and most undervalued niche in the gaming industry– virtual tabletop RPGs. 

Success stories like Baldur's Gate 3, renewed widespread interest in D\&D, and its permeation into mainstream media through films and series like Stranger Things, are evidence of the growing popularity of immersive fantasy worlds. Here are some fun facts for our community as we are building our investment thesis: players and revenues in this genre are set to quadruple by 2028, and there is not a single niche out there expected to grow in this manner. In short, we are leading the pack and couldn’t be in a better market.

There is nothing out there like The Kingdom. With our unique approach to the genre focusing on maximum accessibility and a novel living world that we’ve been building for two years, we are not just participating in this serendipitous boom, but leading the charge in Web3.

## Major Improvements Behind the Scenes

Our mint in December included some of our biggest successes and worst failures. We learned a lot about how to improve and have spent much of 2024 making sure those lessons don’t go to waste.

We have taken one step back in many regards to take two steps forward. This process has taken the better part of two months, but now we are starting our forward strides with massive improvements.

**Here are some highlights:**

* **Onboarding Talent & Experience:** A larger team with the talent and experience needed to handle the journey ahead.
* **Project Optimisation:** More efficient project management and procedures across all departments.
* **Game Development:** We’ve brought in professional game design and development resources so we can create our ideal game, faster and more efficiently.
* **Application:** We’re preparing a fully overhauled application focused on improving the user experience, especially as we begin to add more gear, chests, and rerolls to the application. We can now scale so much as to include even the launch of our game. The marketability and the scalability of our application were limited and in a year with a halving, a BTC ETF, and the potential for an ETH ETF, this was frankly unacceptable.

## Growing Our Team

As you know, RPG Labs, the team behind The Kingdom, is a small and passionate group that has learned hard lessons as it grew from a simple gaming guild to a fantasy world to an innovative Web3 ecosystem with a game on the way.

We’re always looking to bring in the most talented and experienced individuals we can find, and overall have had incredible success doing so. This year our team has grown more than ever:

* **Company Structure, Legal Team & ESOP:** Having a shared goal across the company is crucial, and we are pleased to say that it forms the foundation of our organisation. From top-level management to bottom-level employees, we are all working towards the same objectives and ambitions. Our aim is to encourage every team member to think and act like co-owners. Recently, we received initial funding to establish an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), and we seized the opportunity, knowing that it would help us execute our ambitions more effectively, as every team member is now working towards the same objective. Being bootstrapped by our founder has enabled us to have a clean cap table. This means that making team members co-owners is a simple process, and it leaves us with a war chest to build on the fantastic talent we have already acquired.
* **Art & Animation:** We brought old artists on for more hours and hired two new artists, we are also working with an additional 3D artist/animator with over 30 years of experience in 3D. So far this year, our art team has doubled!
* **Game Dev & Design:** We have brought in additional resources for game design and development, significantly expanding the size and experience of our game development team. The latest iteration of our game design document has evolved from 100 to over 300 pages.
* **Productivity & Automation:** We have brought on efficiency experts and wholly overhauled our use of Notion to unlock the full potential of all team members. This includes an expert in automation for easier tracking of tasks, projects, finance management, and roadmaps.

## New Application

Our new application has been fully designed with working prototypes and Figma files; engineering will commence the start of the overhaul on Monday. The plan will be for you to have your first hands-on look at it in late March or early April.

### Application Improvements:

* **Scalability:** Thanks to the help of our new head of UIUX design, Justin, a 15-year veteran designer, we have been able to meld our current product design with our future game unlike ever before. With this new layout, we can continuously add functionality to the application without compromising the base design.
* **User Experience:** A new dashboard, more precise navigation, and a brand-new flow for equipping and managing gear make the application a breeze to use. We have also incorporated a way to view and select your traits before the mint opens so that the character-creation process can be stress-free.
* **Monetization:** The success of The Kingdom means success for the community, so we have taken steps to incorporate our various product offerings better. The crux of this lies in improving the user experience in our Application and making it easier to explore our ecosystem without needing to create an account.

## Current Application

Even as we planned the new application, we never stopped working on the current one. There were improvements that you the community requested which we felt just couldn’t wait for the new application. Some of these changes have already gone live, others are just around the corner.

* **Questing:** we introduced a new questing schedule with an updated interface that allows for dynamic quest caps and clearer information for the user.
* **Rewards:** our admins can add weapons, armour, or silver to user accounts and avatars. They can also increase the silver generation rate for specific users. This allows us to give value to our most active community members and hold more events with rewards.
* **Avatar Filtering:** we added filtering for Avatars to allow for easier gear optimisation, which means that your Avatars can more easily produce the maximum amount of silver according to your gear strategies.
* **Start Gear Movement:** the functionality for removing the lock on starter gear and allowing it to be moved between Avatars is being tested now on staging. Keep an eye on our announcements; once this functionality is ready to go live, you will have time to make your final class and gear choices before they are locked in and gear movement is unlocked.
* **Mint Fixes:** of course, we had some problems during mint, as we have discussed in previous announcements. Unfortunately, a couple of weeks of January were dedicated to fixing any issues that stemmed from our mint problems. However, this is now behind us, and we are better prepared for next time.

Creating an application that houses not only a cutting-edge NFT customizer but also everything a Web3 gaming community needs to thrive, is not an easy task. Here is a look back at what has gone into creating the current version of the application, to paint a picture of why this upgrade process can’t happen overnight:

* 120,000 lines of TypeScript code
* 300+ units and functional tests
* 15,000 lines of SQL code
* 94 database tables
* 3,600 images + 4 images generated dynamically for each NFT
* 150+ internal settings
* 4 complex smart contracts
* 10+ 3rd party integrations
* 5+ admin support modules

## Gaming, Collaborations, & Giveaways

While the product and marketing teams have been planning and building behind the scenes, our gaming and collaboration efforts have been ongoing.

Here are some of the groups this year with which we have held game nights, collaborations, and giveaways:

* **Twigg:** our lore team has had 2 AMAs with their community, and their members have come to participate in our weekly Aesor D\&D sessions.
* **MixMob:** we co-hosted a game night with this strategic racing game for USDC and tokens.
* **Virtue Poker:** multiple poker games, both open and holders-only, for USDC, Silver, and tokens.
* **Noderunners:** our community was the first to access Noderunner’s space strategy game, playing for USDC.
* **Shrapnel:** As a community, we playtested Shrapnel, one of the most highly anticipated upcoming Web3 games (with whom we share a head of economy). More to come from Shrapenl ;-).
* **Xborg:** we held an AMA and gave away guaranteed spots for their mint

This is not the full list, and it also doesn’t include the many projects we have had to turn down because their quality or “fun factor” was not suitable for The Kingdom. Once marketing begins in earnest, these opportunities are set to increase drastically!

## Roadmap & Marketing 

## Marketing

While we have been building the team and enhancing our products, the marketing team has been working closely with the rest of the company to determine the best strategy moving forward. Now that our roadmap is clear and we are primed for success, marketing efforts will soon commence ahead of the next major event which is the inaugural cross-IP event with top tier community NeoTokyo.

This includes strategies to bring new users into the community, grow the number of unique holders, and increase the sales volume of our collections.
