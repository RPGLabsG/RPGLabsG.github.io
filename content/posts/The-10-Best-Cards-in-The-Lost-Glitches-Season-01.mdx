Hey, Ozone here.

I participated in The Lost Glitches Season 0 and finished in 1st place, which has given me many insights on interestingly powerful cards that can easily go unnoticed. I think about game design and systems way too much and these are the cards I’ve landed on as the best currently.

The Lost Glitches Season 0.1 is well underway right now, with some new cards and lots of quality-of-life improvements being added to the game, and I expect the following choices to be extremely relevant in the current meta.

You should definitely have 3 copies of some of these cards in every deck you create.  The following ranking is in no particular order, since with any card game, there’s too much variability and deck styles to consider any one card above the rest.

Without further ado, let’s get into it.

## The Top 10 List of Cards in The Lost Glitches

Before we begin, I’ll explain how the ranking will work.

I’m going to evaluate the cards according to 3 categories and give each category a rating from 0 to 5.

### The Categories:

**Counterplay: **Represents if there are opportunities to shut the card down.  A score of 5 means you cannot counterplay this card at all. 

**Efficiency: **Represents the stat line and effect compared to its energy cost. A score of 5 means it’s very cheap for a very powerful effect.

**Usability: **Represents if the card needs other cards to function. A score of 5 means it works great on its own, without needing any support.

\-

Lastly, I will also provide reasoning for my choice.

Now we can get started.

## Card #1 - Seafoam Oracle

**Counterplay:** 5

**Efficiency: **4

**Usability: **5

**Best style: **Sacrificial decks preferred. But generally works in everything.

This card actually started as a 2/1– which was insane– but has now been toned down to 1/1.  At only 1, and granting a card draw on death, it seriously cannot be countered. 

Best in sacrificial decks, since it’s meant to die for the draw, but at 1 energy cost it will function in any deck to cycle through your cards and provide utility in your early hand.  

## Card #2 - Defensive Assault

![](<https://kingdom-tinacms-store.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/02. Defnesive Assualt.png>)

**Counterplay: **4

**Efficiency: **4

**Usability: **3

**Best style: **Firewall and Turtle decks

This one was also recently nerfed from +3/3 to +3/0, and boy was that justified.  Even nerfed, this card can provide \~4 power/energy to your field with no negatives. 

There are some limited counters as it’s an installation card, so you can throw other software into the stack.  At 4 cost, it’s available mid-game and can easily provide a game closeout if you already have board control. Functions best in Machinations decks with lots of protectors, but even then will still work in nearly any deck style that is glitch-focused.

## Card #3 - System Crasher

![](<https://kingdom-tinacms-store.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/03. System Crasher.png>)

**Counterplay: **4

**Efficiency: **5

**Usability: **5

**Best style: **Stagger decks preferred. But generally works in everything.

Also nerfed (noticing a trend here) from 4/3 to 3/3 and still is a top card. 

This card’s ability is absurdly good.  While it’s a 3 energy card, it should be thought of as a 5-10 energy card and played mid-late game.  With 8 energy you can easily stagger an entire board to close a game or double on the ability to weaken key threats on the other side.  Because this ability can be used as much as you want, it’s insanely flexible and can be a bomb in any deck.  Stagger decks with scaling on stagger obviously benefit even more.

## Card #4 - Reap and Sow

![](<https://kingdom-tinacms-store.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/04. Reap and Sow.png>)

**Counterplay: **4

**Efficiency: **2-5

**Usability: **5

**Best style: **Software decks and De-Initialization decks

This one is a new addition in Season 0.1, which I think is flying under the radar.  Among the current cards available, card draw effects are limited, thus making cards in hand an intrinsically very valuable resource. 

This card is the only one that forces discards in the game currently, and even does commander damage too.  Because the discard is random, the value of the damage and efficiency will vary, but the discard alone makes this very strong.  It is an installation so can’t be used during the combat phase, but at 3 cost and not affecting glitches on the board, counterplay is quite limited.

## Card #5 - Firewall Tank

![](<https://kingdom-tinacms-store.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/05. Firewall Tank.png>)

**Counterplay: **4

**Efficiency: **3-5 

**Usability: **4

**Best style: **Generally late-game focused decks, such as Firewall and Control decks.

Simply put, this card is just good.  At 4 health with regenerate, it’s able to tank through nearly all removal software and lower-cost cards.  It scales on its own by getting hit, so it can quickly reach 6+ power. 

Firewall decks can scale this up using self-inflicted damage through software like Bumbling Boomerang, and it can easily hold the line until the late-game for control decks.  Even when killed, it often forces a higher resource commitment from your opponent, which can lead to board control or hand count advantage. 

## Card #6 - Crimson Siren

![](<https://kingdom-tinacms-store.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/06. Crimson Siren.png>)

**Counterplay: **3

**Efficiency: **4

**Usability: **5

**Best style:** De-Initialization decks preferred. Can also complement any aggro deck.

Another new card for this season.  When you first read this card’s ability, you might not realize it can be used any time, like a plug-n-play software. 

With it being 1 hp, it can definitely be gimped by removal software, but you can play it on your defensive turn to ensure your opponent has no energy to do so.  This is obviously a double-edged sword with the health cost to use, but the amount of combo denial and energy waste you can force on your opponent is wild.  

## Card #7 - Shadowfall Assassin

![](<https://kingdom-tinacms-store.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/07. Shadowfall Assassin.png>)

**Counterplay: **5

**Efficiency: **4

**Usability: **5

**Best style: **Any aggro or mid-game deck.

This card fills a very similar niche to Seafoam Oracle.  At 1 energy cost with a deathsong that inflicts 2 face damage, it has no counterplay.  

Your opponent simply is going to take damage, so for aggressive and mid-game decks this pushes your tempo without fail.  Can still fill in other deck styles too if there aren’t better 1 drop options to fill your energy curve.  Finally, commander damage is commander damage, and commander damage is always good.

## Card #8 - Gentle Giant&#x9;

![](<https://kingdom-tinacms-store.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/08. Gentle Giant.png>)

**Counterplay: **5

**Efficiency: **3

**Usability:** 5

**Best style:** Machinations and Control decks.

My last 1 energy cost hero on the list, and the first one on the list to be unchanged from its first original concept, thus I can use the cooler card art from the NFT collection, nice.  

Similar to Firewall Tank, at 4 health with regenerate, it’s quite difficult to remove this thing from the board.  It can soak a ton of early-game damage to get late-game decks into the said, late game.  It’s always going to cost your opponent a higher than 1 energy cost investment to kill this card and thus keeps tempo on your side.

## Card #9 - Spirit Avenger

![](<https://kingdom-tinacms-store.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/09. Spirit Avenger.png>) 

**Counterplay: **4

**Efficiency: **3-5

**Usability:** 3

**Best style: **Sacrificial decks or as the bomb in low energy curve aggro.

Yet, another 4 health card with regenerate, yet another pattern.  The key to this card is keeping in mind its power is tied to your current graveyard, not the graveyard count on initialization.  So once out, it can keep scaling if it stays alive.  

At 4 energy, your opponent may be able to counter the tempo with something like two Pretty Stars, but it’s unlikely that’s going to be in their hand by mid-game which means it will require heavy investment for them to remove.  In sacrificial decks, Spirit Avenger can easily hit double-digit power and be the closer to games.

## Card #10 - Vampyr

![](<https://kingdom-tinacms-store.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/10. Vampyr.png>)

**Counterplay: **2

**Efficiency: **5

**Usability: **4

**Best style: **Paired with Crimson Siren or Delicious Infusion but a generalist card overall

Saved this one for last, since I’m still unsure about it. It’s definitely the least consistent among all the cards I’ve picked.  

Extraction is another trait that’s in short supply right now; in the current deck set, you definitely can’t build an extraction/vampire deck.  Vampyr is the highest flat-out power extraction you can just put on the board.  There’s ample chance to counter it with its low 2 health, BUT if you get to attack with it even once, it’s a great value card.  It can trade some of the other top 10 cards I’ve mentioned with that attack value, and getting 20% of your commander pool back is crazy good.

If you manage two combats with it, it provides insane value.
