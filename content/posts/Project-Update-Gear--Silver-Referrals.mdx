## Announcing Our New Referral System!

Starting soon, you can refer your friends to The Kingdom and be rewarded when they mint or pre-order Avatars. There is plenty of Silver up for grabs, as well as some exclusive referral reward gear.

To qualify, a friend must sign up for an account on our application using your referral link, and then mint or pre-order at least 1 Avatar

### Prizes:

Each friend referred who mints an Avatar progresses you to the next prize below.

1st successful referral - 100 Silver + Rare Horned Helm
2nd successful referral - 200 Silver
3rd successful referral - 300 Silver
4th successful referral - 300 Silver
5th successful referral - 300 Silver + Epic Warhorn\
\
After the first 5 successful referrals, you will gain 50 Silver per additional successful referral.

Each of the first 5 friends that you invite who mint an Avatar will also receive 100 Silver themselves!

### How Do I Find My Referral Link?
