# Behind the Scenes of Progress and Innovation

Over the last month, we have opened the curtains to offer a detailed look into the progress we made in August. Each step and each new innovation is a testament to our team’s collective effort to build something extraordinary. 

Today we’ll dive a little deeper, discussing the “why” of our developments, instead of just the “what”.

## Gaming

At the heart of The Kingdom lies our community of gamers. At the end of the day, everything we build is with them in mind, and in August, we redoubled our efforts to provide exciting opportunities for casual and competitive players alike.

#### Twitch & Discord Streams

Our Twitch streams have been alive and kicking with gameplay, from Baldur’s Gate to The Lost Glitches, and any other new or limited release our streamers and community are excited to play and learn more about. 

We wanted these streams to become a focal point for our community, where we can bond over shared gaming experiences, and all walk away a little more knowledgeable as well. So far, this has been a success!

If you haven’t tuned in yet, make sure you follow our accounts, so you can be notified when we stream!

#### Gaming Articles

We’ve started rolling out long-form gaming articles on our blog. Information in Web3 tends to be communicated through short-form content, generally on places like Twitter or Discord where it is quickly lost in the noise. So our team, led by Ozone, is doing the legwork for you and assembling a collection of articles, allowing you to always get the information you need in an easily accessible manner.

#### Competitive TCG  Series

Finally, we noticed that our community has been really enjoying TCGs recently, such as The Lost Glitches, Aradena Battlegrounds, and Gods Unchained. So, during the month of August, we worked to design a TCG tournament series to allow our players to showcase their talents and try their hand at a $1,200 prize-pool along the way.

We’re excited to update you that this TCG series is now underway, spread out between three events:

* Gods Unchained: September 30th | 5PM UTC
* Parallel: October 7th | 5PM UTC
* Cross the Ages: October 14th | 5PM UTC

#### Games Galore

This barely scratches the surface of all the gaming events that we hosted in August; each week offers a handful of opportunities, and we make sure to vary the time of day to accommodate different time zones. 

So if you’re looking for a new game to play, or for people to play your favorite games with, just drop by our Discord and say hi! You even get to receive points towards our ongoing Community Rewards whilst at it.

## Marketing

There is a running joke in The Kingdom’s team that it is actually the marketing department (Looking at you, Alex) that creates the most work for everyone else, as every campaign they design requires all the other teams to pitch in. 

For instance, the Riddles needed to be written by the lore team, illustrated by our artists, designed by our UI/UX team, programmed by our engineers, and facilitated by our community team. So when you’re reading about everything that we’ve done in August, know that it was ultimately the marketing team behind a lot of it.

#### Launch Plan

We plan to launch the Avatar Configurator at the end of October, which will allow our community to assemble their own unique The Kingdom Avatars, choosing all of their traits themselves, as well as a class and some basic weapons and armor.

Of course, this required a marketing plan that details everything from social media strategies to community experience involving our pre-launch application. The marketing team was able to put together a comprehensive plan that includes aspects such as:

* Social media campaigns
* Giveaway schedules
* Community Reward System
* Episodic Riddles
* Fantasy Race Personality Quiz
* TCG Championship Series
* Casual & Competitive Gaming Events

#### TK Blog

As mentioned in the “gaming” section above, we believe that more long-form content is sorely needed in Web3. However, a blog also has other benefits, including the improved potential to be found by search engines through SEO, and a method of disseminating project updates to our community through a more permanent and better-formatted medium.

So, our marketing team has taken charge of ensuring that we supply a regular stream of articles on a wide range of topics, including:

* Project Updates
* Development Logs
* Gaming Articles
* Technology Articles

#### Pitch Deck

While many in our community already know and love The Kingdom and its vision for the future, communicating that vision to newcomers and other projects that wish to reach and partner with can be difficult.

For this reason, we have taken the time to create a professional pitch deck, which is already being used to bolster our outreach efforts right now. It is a constantly iterative process and a new one is already underway. 

## Engineering

Perhaps the busiest team in August was engineering, who had their hands full not only with working on the Avatar Configurator itself but also with the development of all the community initiatives involved in our launch. By the end of August, a plan was in place to carry us through our application launch, and development was well underway.

#### Launch Initiatives

The goal of our launch initiatives is to reward and entertain our loyal community, while also providing avenues for further growth. Of course, none of these systems would be possible without our engineering team:

* Community Rewards Quests: Completing quests involving everything from gaming with The Kingdom, to helping us grow the community. At the same time, gain points on our leaderboard for prizes at the end of the season.
* Riddle Stories: Explore the world of Aesor through three episodic riddle stories. You’ll be able to solve puzzles, earn exclusive cosmetic rewards, and Community Rewards points, and even shape the future of Aesor through the decisions you make along the way.
* Fantasy Race Quiz: There are many different races on Aesor, take our quiz to discover which of Aesors’ fantasy races is most suited to become your first Avatar.

#### Application Launch Plan

With so many different parts of the application to roll out over the following months, designing a schedule for when and how to release new parts of the application was a necessity.

The first part of this is our “Start” application, which is now live! The full application, including the Avatar Configurator, is planned to go live at the end of October.

#### RMRK NFT 2.0 Legos

One of The Kingdom’s central goals is to utilize cutting-edge technology in order to enhance traditional experiences. While NFTs are a recent technology, we have found that there are many improvements that could still be made, especially when it comes to user experience, especially for gamers.

So, in August, our engineers worked closely with the developers at RMRK to plan the details of our integration of their NFT 2.0 legos into our Avatar Configurator. This will enable us to use tech such as drag-and-drop equippable NFTs so that when you equip a weapon or armor, it actually reflects on the blockchain, creating a more familiar and engaging experience for our players.
\
Another example is nestable soulbound tokens, a system that enables us to nest soulbound tokens in the Avatar themselves. This means that certain titles or other game elements can be linked to an Avatar instead of a player, so they are guaranteed to transfer with any sale and act as an on-chain record of that Avatar’s journey on Aesor. Think of it as a record of an Avatar's life in our living story.

## Game Design

While most of the community’s focus is on the Launch Initiatives and our regular gaming opportunities, our game design has been hard at work preparing for the next phase of The Kingdom.

One part of The Kingdom that will allow it to stand apart from other collections, communities, and questing systems is the Social RPG-Lite that we are building as a companion to our community. Creating a game such as this will of course be a significant undertaking, and work has been done on paper for nearly a year now, but as of August, development is officially underway in Unity!

#### First Community Look

One of the main goals for August was planning an MVP, for us to show the community how we expect the game to look and function. This won’t be completed in a month, of course, but we hope to soon be able to share some images and videos highlighting our progress thus far.

#### Team-Friendly Infrastructure

As a smaller team, we do not have the resources that many full game studios do. For this reason, we have taken a different approach to game development, meaning we are creating systems within Unity that will allow members of the team without development experience to be able to help flesh out the world of Aesor without the need for specialized skills.

One example of this is a city-creation interface, which will enable the lore team to come in and help build the many cities and towns of Aesor by easily selecting from menus what should be present in each location, what each location should look like, and which NPCs can be accessed there.

This should significantly stretch our resources and allow us to deliver a game much quicker than we would if only our development team were able to work on it. It also will allow us to more easily augment the gameplay experience as the living world of Aesor evolves from season to season based on the decisions of players. Not to mention that the team members most familiar with how the world should look and feel can have a direct influence on it, so it quickly became a no-brainer approach for us.

#### On-Chain Reputation System

We believe that community members should have a verifiable way to display their achievements– anything they accomplish in-game, or in the wider ecosystem, should be tracked and presentable. In August we worked on fleshing out the Title system of our Social RPG Lite, which encompasses both player-bound and avatar-bound titles, made possible by the RMKR NFT 2.0 legos.

#### Crafting System

Crafting systems are one of the most important parts of some of our favorite RPGs, so of course we want to include one in ours. However, we wanted to mix it up from the standard crafting systems that most are familiar with.

We landed on a generative hex-based system in which location and movement matter! Although this is difficult to talk about without actually seeing it first, this will be one of the next things we start development on once we have finished our current stages of the map and UI. It will be very interesting to see players getting their hands on it and experimenting with such a distinct system!

## Design and Art

First impressions are important in nearly all aspects of life, and this is doubly true when it comes to art and design. So much of August was focused on generally improving the quality of what we already had– though of course, this is always something we are working on improving, even at the time of writing this.

#### Character Race Selection

One of the first impressions of a game is the character selection screen, so one task we undertook in August was to revamp our own character race selection screen. It was a lot of work, and we are very excited for you to experience the final result There is no doubt it will  create a great first impression now.

#### NFT Traits

While our previous traits were good, they were not quite great. In order for proper immersion, it is important that the collection be consistent, not just in quality and art style, but also in the individual identities of each race. We also just wanted to make the traits cooler.

So, in August we finalized our process of redoing over two-thirds of our 520 traits, addressing both the male and female collections. The traits have been loaded in the configurator, and we can’t wait for you to become lost with all the different options while building your own Avatar!

#### Expanding Team

In order to deliver our full vision of Aesor, we have realized we need to increase our art output dramatically. This resulted in our initial search for new artists in August, which ultimately culminated in adding two new artists to the team! More on that in the September updates.

#### UI Overhaul

As we grew closer to launch, we realized that there was a great deal that we could still do to improve the user interface of our application. It is important for us that our community has the best experience possible when using our products, and that includes everything functioning intuitively.

Some of the aspects of our application that were touched in this redesign were the inventory system, the NFTs themselves, and the mint pages. Some of the functionality that will be added once these designs are integrated fully into the application are:

* Ability to move items to a “player vault”, allowing users more control over what they can do with their Avatars and gear.
* Added multi-page interactive features to the NFTs, as well as new animations.
* New indicators of mint status, and a more appealing minting process.

## Lore

While The Kingdom’s team has grown to cover everything from art, design, marketing, engineering, and more, it all started with the lore. Building an immersive fantasy world is only possible if all aspects of the world are able to fit harmoniously together, without any glaring plot holes or inconsistencies. As we get closer to launch, the lore is finally being shared with the community, something which we spent a lot of time preparing for in August.

#### Riddles

One of the first ways in which the community will be able to experience a story set on Aesor will be during our episodic riddles. At The Kingdom, we have had the pleasure to enjoy the riddles of many Web3 projects, and have learned a lot about how we would try to improve on them if we ever did our own. In August, we put those lessons to use and developed a three-part riddle series that spans three continents and introduces three of the races of Aesor to the community.

When players make decisions in our community, we strive always to make sure to empower those players by demonstrating real consequences to those decisions. The world of Aesor is meant to be shaped by all of The Kingdom’s members, not just the lore team. We took this philosophy to heart when developing these riddles, and have designed them so that the players will make some big decisions that have momentous consequences both in future riddles, and in the world of Aesor as it will first appear in our game.

The first of these riddles has gone live just this week, and our community is roughly halfway through this first leg of their journey. Whether you are joining in live, or want to play through them at a later time, you can find all the details you need below:

#### Aesor Wiki

Throughout August, the lore team worked on our comprehensive wiki of all things Aesor… everything that isn’t a secret to the story anyway! While we hope to display most of our lore through gameplay and other media, as fantasy nerds ourselves, we wanted to make sure there was a place where the community could go to learn more about Aesor than is officially published so far.

While it is still a work in progress, the first version of the wiki is now live, and can be found here: 

[https://www.worldanvil.com/w/aesor-themadkingloktra](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/aesor-themadkingloktra)

If you are participating in our riddles or plan on minting an Avatar, a little further research might go a long way!

#### Game Design Fictionalization

Another aspect of Aesor’s story that must remain consistent for it to become immersive is the Social RPG-Lite that we are developing. In August, the lore team worked especially closely with the game design team in order to help fictionalize aspects of the game mechanics. For instance, Aesor has a complex system of Marcy and Elements that has now been properly translated into exciting gameplay mechanics. By designing gameplay and lore separately and then combining them, we ensure that neither of these important components of a good game is given anything less than a team’s full love and attention.

#### Future Seasons

Although our game is still under development, we believe it is important to keep an eye on the horizon and plan for the future that we are building towards. To this end, the lore team mapped out a seasonal structure that can carry The Kingdom far into the future, with no end of meaningful stories in sight. Even better, is that the game design team has been building with modularity in mind, meaning that we will be able to easily update the world of Aesor with new stories, items, and experiences for each new season.

## Summary

If we had to characterize August in one word, it would be “preparation”. If you are participating in our community now, during September, you can certainly see the fruits of this preparation, and we hope you are encouraged to stick around and see the products that we’ve been working so hard to build for you.

Thank you, Aesar
