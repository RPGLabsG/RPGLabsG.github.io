Welcome, Aesor community! In September, The Kingdom was bustling with activities, from exciting tournaments to friendly get-togethers, designed to get us all ready for the upcoming launch! Let’s delve into a recap of these past events and the other successes of the FoH team in September.

### Streaming Adventures and Discoveries

This month, our Twitch streams saw us diving into numerous virtual worlds, including those of BG3, Inkbound, TLG, Parallel, Lies of P, and more. Our community had a chance to immerse themselves in hours of gameplay, sharing experiences, and unraveling secrets together, making each stream not just a watch, but a participatory adventure.

### Engaged Marketing Strategies

After receiving a great opportunity to share our pitch deck with some amazing projects, we implemented key changes and enhanced its visual and informative quality to be even more compelling. One of our core philosophies is that there is always something that can be improved, and we are often looking for opportunities to take one step back in order to take two steps forward, stronger than before.

A thorough review of our marketing plan was also undertaken with the help of experienced marketers in the space, who appreciated its thoroughness while also highlighting areas for improvement leading up to our launch. It is important to us to always seek feedback and improve based on the knowledge and experience of others. 

These insights led to the development of a refined launch plan and other new developments to ensure our approach is not just innovative but also organized. We are now better equipped than ever to grow The Kingdom and fulfill our vision of the ultimate gaming community.

### Riding the Wave of Tournament Excitement

Our TCG Tourney Series is well underway, with the Gods Unchained and Parallel segments completed, leaving Cross the Ages as your only chance left to demonstrate your TCG skill. These tournaments have been an eventful ride, and we’re only getting started! A huge thank you to everyone who has helped run these events, and to all the participants who did their part and made sure everyone could have an awesome time doing what they do best– gaming!

### Avatar Launch Promo Video

After helping with our pitch deck, one of our favorite Neo Tokyo Citizens, LeBoomington, turned his sights on developing a promotional teaser video for our Avatar Configurator. This involved writing a script alongside the team, and then letting the video wizard work his magic! We won’t spoil anything here, but we think you’ll like what he came up with. 

Everyone learns about projects differently; while some prefer tuning into twitter spaces or diving into project documents, most seem to prefer the ease of simply watching a short video. We’re hoping that with this new format, we’ll be able to spread the word of Aesor further than ever!

### Dynamic Marketing

Our marketing lead, Alex, is always extending his expertise, offering pivotal strategies and on-the-spot feedback to various team departments, bolstering our ongoing efforts with cohesive advancements all throughout. One of the pivots he designed in September was to make the switch more to user-focused language in our announcements and promotional materials, trying to highlight the ways in which the initiatives and products of The Kingdom can benefit YOU. Ultimately, that is what this is all about.

### Narratives with The Bornless

Keeping you in the loop, we’ve drafted a comprehensive blog update for Bornless, ensuring it's friendly for all, irrespective of your familiarity with web3, perfectly timed with their Steam playtest release. Exciting news to come soon regarding the Bornless and our next tournament!

### Engaging Across All Gaming Areas

September saw us not only in competitive spirits but also ensuring casual fun was plenty. From lending a hand in organizing casual gaming nights involving EVIO, MTG, & Aradena, to shaping up both laid-back and competitive gaming events, we maintained a good balance of fun and rivalry. All the while, our interactions on Twitter and continuous Discord improvements helped keep the community alive and welcoming– but of course, we couldn’t do it without you all, thank you!
