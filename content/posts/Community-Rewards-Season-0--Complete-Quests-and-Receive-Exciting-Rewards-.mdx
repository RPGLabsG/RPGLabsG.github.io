We’re excited to announce the start of our Community Rewards Season 0, as well as the Pre-Launch version of our application!

Our Community Rewards “Questing” system is designed to help all of the adventurers who decide to join us on the journey to reach new heights.

Whether you’re a fresh face in the community, an OG who has been here from the start, or a long time lurker, everyone can participate and get rewarded for completing our quests. No need to purchase any passes, nor go through limited time offers. 

Right now, this is our Pre-Launch Season 0. Which will last from September 15th until October 23rd. 

Keep on reading to learn how you can make the most of our Community Rewards and what to expect out of our Pre-Launch Application.

### What are The Kingdom's Community Rewards?

A quest system designed to reward The Kingdom’s community members for doing what they do best, gaming & engaging with the rest of the community. It also rewards those who spread the word and make an effort to tell their friends and communities about what The Kingdom is doing. 

You’ll complete quests from our quest list, submit proof through a submission portal on our application, and be awarded points by TK Team Members for successful completion of quests. Each quest has a few simple guidelines and measures to ensure a fair playing ground, limiting the risk of foul play like botting, or other unfair advantages.

Tasks include attending events by The Kingdom, playing together with us, talking about us on social media, and a lot more. You can find the full list of quests in the graphics at the bottom of this document.

The points you earn will be added to your account and displayed on a public Season 0 leaderboard. At the end of the season, those with the most points will win!

We have some exciting rewards in store for you, such as a Steam Deck, Gift Cards, NFTs, and even exclusive gear and titles that can be utilized with your The Kingdom Avatar, which will be available to mint nearer the end of the season.

The gear and titles offered here will never be available any other time, so this is your chance to claim a piece of The Kingdom’s early history for yourself and leave your mark on Aesor & our leaderboards!\

## The Prizes You’re Playing For 

1. Partner Project NFTs (Chronoforge, Warriors of Aradena, The Bornless, and more)
2. Avatar Free Mint and Mint Discounts
3. Steam Gift Cards
4. Exclusive Gear & Titles

And of course, our grand prize: 1 Steam Deck\


We’ve set the prize pool up in such a way that everyone can win something at the end of the Season, but of course those who are at the top of the leaderboard will receive the best prizes. So don’t waste any time and get started playing today!

One of the core features we have built The Kingdom on is accessibility. We believe that the high barrier to entry of many NFT projects is detrimental to the space, especially when it comes to Web3 gaming.

We have kept this in mind when designing our reward system, ensuring that anyone who participates diligently and contributes to the success of the community will receive the discounts needed to be able to mint their Avatar at a much more accessible price point than the status quo in Web3.

Rules & Guidelines
------------------

Depending on the type of submission there will be different guidelines to follow. The detailed guidelines for each quest type can be found in the graphics at the bottom of this article, but here are some general rules to keep in mind:

* Some quests will only be able to be submitted once. If you have submitted a quest already for a single-time entry, you will have to wait to learn if your quest was accepted or denied before submitting it again.
* Whether a submission is counted for points or not, is ultimately at the discretion of our community team. We reserve the right to reward, deny, or remove points as we deem necessary.
* Fake or Botted submissions will be disqualified.
* Feel free to be honest with your submission, but please be respectful.
* Avoid low-effort submissions. 
* Repeated content will be disqualified.

# Community Rewards FAQ

Q: Where can I check the possible tasks?

A: The current available tasks can be found in the graphics at the bottom of this article.\
\
Q: How are rewards claimed? 

A: When a quest you have submitted is approved by a TK Team Member, or if you complete a quest that is automatically verified, you will receive points. You can view your points in The Kingdom’s application, either by navigating through “Standings” in the settings menu, or by clicking on the “Quest Leaderboard”. 

At the end of the season, we’ll award prizes based on everyone’s standings.  \
\
Q: How many people will win prizes?

A: Not ahead in the leaderboard? Worried you won’t have the time to fight for 1st place? 

No worries! We have plenty of prizes to go around, and all who participate will win something.

You will also earn discounts against minting your avatar along the way through entering participation codes! (More on that below)

Q: Is there a maximum daily amount of points that can be earned?

A: There is no daily maximum amount of points, however some quests can only be completed a certain amount of times. For instance, some quests can only be done once a day, or only once during the rewards season.

We also encourage you to take your time with some of the more in-depth quests, such as creating Fan Art or Gaming Content. 

Q: Help! My submission didn’t award any points!

A: If your submission is referred to as ‘Rejected’, then it did not qualify for the quest and therefore does not award any points. Otherwise, please stay patient! Sometimes they can take a while to update. If after 48 hours, your submission has not been counted, nor referred to as ‘Rejected’, please submit a ticket within Discord. 

Q: My submission was declined, what happened?

A: Unfortunately, it either broke one of our rules, or didn’t abide by our content guidelines.

Q: What will happen to my points and leaderboard position after this?

A: Your total points will be recorded on our Community Leaderboard, but a new seasonal leaderboard will be generated for different, future community rewards initiatives.

## Pre-Launch Application

While exploring the application you might notice some other exciting features! We will explore these in more detail in future blog posts, but here is a quick overview of some of what the application has, and will have, to offer in its pre-launch phase.

Participation Discount Codes

Moving forward, you will sometimes have the opportunity to earn discounts on the mint price of your Avatar by attending our Discord & Twitter events! 

We’ll make sure to keep you in the loop as to when these opportunities arise.

Referral Discount Codes

You can also earn discounts toward the mint price of your Avatar by referring friends to The Kingdom who end up minting their Avatars.

Full Menu & Future Initiatives

Soon you will also notice an update to the application that includes some spoilers to the other exciting things that we have planned for this next month!

Make sure to check back in periodically so you don’t miss any of our exciting upcoming initiatives.

## Detailed Submission Guidelines

The quests are broken down into four categories: Gaming, Social, Content, and Community. It is only the total amount of points that matters in the final standing, but you will be able to see where you stack up against your fellow community members in these categories as well!\
