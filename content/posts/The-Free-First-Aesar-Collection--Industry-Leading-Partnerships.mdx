### Two massive industry giants join hands with The Kingdom to guarantee the best user experience. A new exclusive free mint collection is around the corner, and you get to enjoy it for free.

We are proud to announce that Polygon Labs, a cutting-edge blockchain infrastructure, and Magic Eden, the leading community-centric NFT marketplace, are now partnered with The Kingdom!

With the Avatar Collection releasing very soon this November, the time has come to ensure we are aligned with the best in the industry to deliver the best experience for our players.

Furthermore, to start our flagship application release with the best foot forward, we are rewarding our community of early adopters, as well as partners with an entirely Free Mint, the First Aesar Founder’s Chests Collection.

And if you’re reading this, odds are, you are very much in time to benefit from everything.

## The First Aesar Free Mint

One of the benefits of our Avatar Collection is the fact each Avatar’s rarity is entirely dynamic and can be upgraded through equipment. The higher tier of the equipped gear on your avatar, the higher the rarity, and the more valuable it becomes.

This is where our First Aesar collection comes in. Before Avatars are out, we will be releasing a series of 999 Founder Chests, each one containing at least one unique weapon of Uncommon, Rare, or Epic rarity. These weapons will evolve in appearance with each rarity, and will be exclusive to these chests- you won’t be able to find them anywhere else. Ever.

We have something special in the works to ensure these weapon rarities won’t stop at Epic too, but that is a little secret for now. You will have to stay tuned to learn more about this… Soon.

#### **Founder Chests Features**

* **Limited Supply** of 999 Founder Chests
* **3 Different Types:** Melee, Ranged & Marcry 
* Uncommon, Rare & Epic Rarities
* Equip Your Avatar With High-Tier Equipment Early

There will be more to learn about the Founder Chests, this is just the beginning.

#### **Now introducing Polygon Labs and Magic Eden as our new flagship partners! **

We strongly believe Polygon Labs is moving the Web3 space in the right direction, by providing great user experiences with their low fees, secure operations, and a very scalable ecosystem to help us take The Kingdom to the next level. We have begun utilizing the Polygon ecosystem by first [integrating RMRK](https://blog.the-kingdom.world/posts/Partnership-Announcement-RMRK) Modular NFT technology into our avatar collection, giving our players full control over their assets, and we look forward to creating even more exciting possibilities through their technology!

Many games in Web3 utilize Polygon blockchains to deliver their experience to players right now. Learn more about this on their blog: [https://polygon.technology/blog-tags/gaming](https://polygon.technology/blog-tags/gaming) 

After all is said and done, it also quickly became important to have a great marketplace to showcase the creations that our community will come up with, and Magic Eden was the perfect fit. Their marketplace is not only elegant and beautifully designed, but it’s also community-centric and makes the discoverability of new collections feel much easier. We are sure our avatars will be displayed at their best through their marketplace. 

Magic Eden currently hosts countless great collections you can browse right now, check them out here: [https://magiceden.io/popular-collections](https://magiceden.io/popular-collections) 

Our new partners are completely aligned with our vision, just like we are with theirs: to provide an easily accessible, and high-quality experience to our users, many of which will be completely new to advanced blockchain technologies. 

#### **How does this benefit The Kingdom Players?**

These partnerships not only ensure we will have everything we need to make a smooth launch visible to everyone, but also the means to have a direct line to the latest technologies in Web3, to create the most enjoyable and functional products we can for our community.

One other aspect is longevity. The fact these two giants believe in our vision for the future of Web3 and The Kingdom gives us immense confidence in what we are building, and that we can completely transform the way players interact with Web3 technologies in gaming. We are immensely grateful for everything, and our partners for their valuable vote of confidence.

## It Doesn’t End Here

The First Aesar Collection and Avatar release are just the beginning. We have many surprises in store to elevate the possibility of our Avatars. Getting them in your hands to create and shape as you see fit is our very first step.

Stay tuned with everything that is happening with The Kingdom by creating an account at the-kingdom.world, and participating in our systems and events. 

We will talk to you again soon, Aesars. \
