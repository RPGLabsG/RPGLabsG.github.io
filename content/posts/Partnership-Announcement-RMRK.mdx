### Introduction

At The Kingdom, we believe in using the power of frontier technologies to enhance “traditional” experiences, such as gaming, storytelling, and even NFTs. That’s right, even though NFTs are a relatively cutting-edge technology themselves, there are vast improvements that have been made by projects like RMRK that we intend to embrace.

That is why we are so excited to be officially announcing our partnership with RMRK, whose Modular NFT Technology we have already begun incorporating into our application. 

Maybe you’ve already learned of some of the novel functionality of our NFTs and wondered how it was possible, now you know! It is all thanks to the “magic” of RMRK.

Just as when working with any new technology, implementation wasn’t always easy or cost-free. But we believe that it is well worth the effort in order to deliver a final product that allows you, our community, to take full charge of your own decisions when creating your own unique NFT, and that lays the groundwork necessary for our eventual RPG to operate in the most intuitive way with the most functionality possible.

In this article, we’ll explore what exactly RMRK’s Modular NFTs are, and how we are using them in The Kingdom.

### What are Modular NFTs?

RMRK’s Modular NFTs consist of a set of ERC721-compatible standards that can either be used on their own, or added together to create more complex systems. Think of them as building blocks that can be used to create new and improved NFT experiences, designed to fit the needs of a wide variety of different applications, from gaming to music, video, collectible art, operations and tracking, and more. Really, as is the case with most modular technologies, the possible use cases are as endless as your own imagination.

### MultiAsset NFTs ([ERC-5773](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5773))

ERC-5773, better known as RMRK’s “MultiAsset” standard, enables tokens to have multiple types of assets associated with them, such as images, audio, video, or other digital files. These assets can then programmatically display depending on the context in which the NFT is being viewed or used.

Imagine, one NFT that when opened in an ebook reader displays as a novel, when opened in a video player displays as a film, and when opened in an audio player displays as the film's extended soundtrack. 

This context could also be decided by the users themselves. For instance, a profile picture that is displayed differently depending on the platform, or depending on the user’s relationship to who is viewing it.

Another potential use case that we find particularly interesting is in the context of a gaming metaverse. In a theoretical metaverse where assets can cross over between different game worlds, a multi-asset NFT could be programmed to display differently depending on the world it is currently being used in.

### Multi-Asset NFTs in The Kingdom

One way we intend to make use of ERC-5773 is to transform our NFTs from simple images or videos into interactive character profiles with animated backgrounds. You’ll be able to switch between different views, displaying your Avatar’s stats, as well as the information about the gear they have equipped. We are also implementing tooltips so that you can check an Avatar’s gear at a glance, simply by hovering over the image.

To be clear, we already have this functionality on marketplaces like OpenSea, and are working closely with RMRK to determine when the functionality can be employed on their marketplace, Singular. In the future, we’ll certainly be looking for more ways to implement the MultiAsset standard, because as we demonstrated above, it is a very powerful tool for NFTs!

### Composable NFTs utilizing Equippable Parts ([ERC-6220](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6220))

This standard allows an NFT to “equip” other NFTs, attaching them to specific slots, causing them to be rendered together when displayed. As with MultiAsset, the possibilities for this standard to improve the end-user's experience are nearly limitless. We won’t get into them all, but here are a few examples from both within and outside of the gaming industry:

* Trading Card Games: NFT cards could be fused together, creating rarer or more powerful versions. Likewise, power-ups or other components could be modularly added to cards.
* First-Person Shooter: NFT skins could be attached to guns or to player’s avatars. Progress tracking “titles” could be equipped as well.
* Movies: A base version of a movie can be equipped with features such as extended scenes or other bonus content.
* Music: A track can be composed of multiple instrument tracks equipped together.

### Nestable NFTs ([ERC-6059](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6059))

The simplest way to understand RMRK’s Nestable Standard is that it allows NFTs to “own” other NFTs, whereas previously only Externally Owned Accounts or smart contracts could own an NFT. Another way to describe this would be by saying one NFT is essentially being placed inside of another one. 

There are many uses for this, but a few that first come to mind are:

* Bundling NFTs, either from the same collection or different collections altogether, allows for single-transaction transfer of these NFTs.
* Collecting multiple NFTs within one parent NFT for the sake of organizing and keeping track of information.
* A project can mint a new NFT directly into NFTs from a previous collection.

### Composable & Nestable NFTs in The Kingdom

The ability to equip or nest an NFT with other NFTs is a large part of what originally led us to seek out a partnership with RMRK, as it is what allows our Avatars to be equipped with NFT Weapons and Armor or to nest things like soulbound token titles.

#### Equipping NFT Items

It has always been our vision that gamers should be able to mint their in-game gear as NFTs, and being able to actually equip those items on-chain is the next logical step. This means that community members can not only customize their unique Avatar and mint it as an NFT, but they can also customize their Avatar further by equipping weapons and armor. The rarer the weapons or armor that are equipped, the rarer the underlying Avatar becomes.

#### Nesting Soulbound Tokens

Another way we plan to utilize the Nestable NFTs is by using soulbound tokens in the form of in-game titles to create on-chain histories of each Avatar, a record of that Avatar’s place within Aesor. For instance, perhaps an Avatar becomes King of Alar, causing their soulbound token to update and make a record of this. Just as in the real world, even when that Avatar is no longer King of Alar, there will still forever be that record that at one time it held the throne.

#### Mounts, Banners, Borders, and More

RMRK’s modular NFTs are designed in such a way that we can easily add functionality in the future, and we have plenty of exciting ideas for things to include. For instance, perhaps a special mount or familiar can be soulbound to each Avatar, haven’t you always wanted your own personal dragon? Or perhaps a personal banner for your Avatar that updates to reflect your journey through Aesor? Maybe cool borders for your NFT to represent things such as accomplishments or rarity?

The opportunities really are endless, and we can’t wait to layer further functionality onto our NFTs for you to explore and enjoy!
