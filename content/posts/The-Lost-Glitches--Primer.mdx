### Quick Summary

Don’t have 10-15 minutes to learn all about The Lost Glitches?  Then this paragraph is for you. If you do have the time, however, feel free to skip to the intro.  

The Lost Glitches is an upcoming Web3 trading card game (TCG) and role-playing game, being developed by Mimunga Gaming.  It’s cyberpunk-themed both in art and lore, with fantastic-looking cards and UI.  The game just entered its limited alpha on the Epic Games Store and spots are, as implied, limited.  

Use this form if you'd like to apply for the limited alpha: [Season 0 Form](https://forms.gle/zot1RJxRLKgZfCwGA)

The Lost Glitches has a 10K NFT Collection on Ethereum with utility and perks for the game, which are separate from their cards (also NFTs) that can be found on ImmutableX.  This game is currently a bit of sleeper since their team has deliberately avoided the normal web3 drip-feed marketing, but you’ll likely be seeing plenty of news as they begin marketing near full-launch.

### What is The Lost Glitches?

The Lost Glitches is a Web3 trading card and role-playing game, being developed by Mimunga Gaming, currently available on the Epic Game Store in its limited alpha.   

The game takes place within the Deep Sky Network.  A future post-apocalyptic digital existence where there’s not enough memory to go around and you must fight for your memories.  There’s not much lore for the game yet but the idea certainly hooks you in.  

The game was originally funded by its 10K NFT collection sale, with these NFTs providing utility and perks for the full game release sometime next year.  The cards are also NFTs and have been slowly rolling out through booster pack sales.  

The limited alpha or Season 0 as it is referred to, features deck building and a ranked leaderboard with some really juicy rewards for the top players, including physical cards.  We’ll be diving into how to get access to the alpha, what you can expect from the gameplay, and some history of the project.

### How To Get Started?

The Lost Glitches has moved into their “limited alpha”, which is only on the Epic Game Store.  So first things first, if you don’t have an Epic Games account yet, you will need to go to their website, create an account, and download the Epic Games launcher.  Epic Games has been quickly onboarding Web3 games and frequently gives away high-quality free games on their application, so it is a good idea to keep it on your PC regardless.  

Next, you're going to need to fill out this questionnaire from their team: [Season 0 Form.](https://forms.gle/zot1RJxRLKgZfCwGA)

This alpha phase is limited in spots as the name implies and they are giving priority to: 

* Experienced TCG players
* Active discord community members
* TCG influencers and leaders of gaming communities   

If you don’t meet that criteria, no need to worry, being active in their discord is the one requirement anyone can hit. So this is your chance to get in there and say your ‘GMs’.

If you’re accepted to the alpha you’ll be contacted directly via the email you provided with login credentials for a Lost Glitches account.  Download the game from the Epic Games launcher, log in with said email/password and it’s finally time to fight for your memories. \

### Gameplay Overview: Features, Battle Phases, Deck Types

The Lost Glitches is a trading card game (TCG) with role-playing game elements (RPG).  At the time of writing this primer, the number of players in the limited alpha is still double digits, with over 4,000 on the waiting list.  As expected, the alpha doesn’t have all game features yet, but it does have many I am always looking for in a great TCG.  These being: a deck builder, private matchmaking via a password, as well as daily, weekly, and monthly quests.  As an exciting surprise, some of these weekly and monthly quests will net you $LOST tokens, to be used for future booster packs and other in-game purchases.  

The Lost Glitches is a very reactive TCG, both players have opportunities to interact with the board in every phase and sub-phase.  The phrasing is quite unique and does take some getting used to compared to a standard TCG, but players familiar with Yu-Gi-Oh battle phases may feel right at home. 

The phases breakdown as follows:

1. Precombat Phase: The current attacking player draws a card, gains 1 max energy, and refills all energy.  Both players can play glitches and software but typically only the attacker will be playing here unless the defender kept mana in reserve on purpose.
2. Combat Attack Phase: The attacker declares which of their glitch will attack.  Plug-and-play software can also be played.
3. Combat Defensive Phase: The defender declares which of their glitches will defend which attacking glitch.  Plug-and-play software can also be played.
4. Combat Resolution Phase: Glitches fight and resolve all actions.  Plug-and-play software can also be played.
5. Postcombat Phase: Both players can play glitches and software.  Typically little happens in this phase as both players are out of energy at this point but you never know.

From here, players swap attack and defense positions, and the phases repeat. It should also be noted that on the first turn of the game, the defensive player gets to start with 1 energy to help offset going second.  

As with most TCGs, there are keywords on cards that define their functions and abilities.  For example, the keyword “extraction” returns damage done to the player as health similar to “lifesteal” in Hearthstone.  The same goes for card types.  For example “plug and play software” cards are similar to “instant” spell cards in Magic The Gathering, for you, experienced TCG players out there.  

The last wrinkle in the gameplay is the commander skills.  You pick 3 for your deck, which vary in cost but can be used unlimited times each, allowing you to respond to situations.  Every turn players gain one skill point, and it’s also a separate resource pool to manage outside of energy used to play everything else.

In terms of cards/deck types, there are currently 5 syndicates.  

* Adamant Hands is a defensive late-game syndicate.  The glitches within it have lots of health and scale by taking damage.  If opponents aren't able to fully destroy a glitch in 1 turn they are likely in for a nasty counter punch.  
* Curators Maxima (my favorite) is an aggressive blitz archetype that floods the board.  Many of the glitches in this syndicate scale via the death of other allies and/or sacrificing them.
* Guardians Of The Source is another late-game syndicate but with a focus on stealing resources and glitches from your opponent.  A key recruitment of an enemy glitch can often amp your own glitches and by using their own glitch against them, seal the game.  
* Sentinels Of Eternity might imply defense but it’s quite the opposite.  This syndicate is focused on aggressive attacks that are supplemented by a high amount of stagger making it so your opponent can’t punch back before it’s too late.  

Song Of The Chain focuses on software-heavy decks, with units that benefit from software and allow you to cycle through your deck and cast often.

### Boosters & Tokens: How They Work and Their Utility?

Being a TCG, the most important tokenized assets are the cards.  The Lost Glitches Card Collection is on ImmutableX.  The preferred IMX marketplace from their team is aqua.xyz, although I’ll mention I’m partial to tokentrove.com for their clean UI and detailed info on each card.  

The team has been rolling out the entire card collection through booster pack sales in 6 parts, of which 4 have been completed during the time of writing.  The cards have 3 tiers of editions: classic, exclusive, and collectors, all of which have their respective genesis versions as well.  The card art in general is awesome, but I will note the collector's tier really stands out, visually.

The booster packs include 5 cards and have 3 Tiers of rarity: Bronze, Silver, and Gold.  Gold in particular guarantees at least one collector's edition and has an additional card included for a total of 6.  The genesis boosters can be purchased during limited time windows with ETH, USDC, and $LOST tokens. 

My personal strategy has been to get a couple gold packs and then a bunch of bronze.  Decks will allow 3 copies of each card so I’ve prioritized trying to get 3 copies of them all even if the bronze packs are mostly classic editions.  I want to have the flexibility to build any deck.  Not financial advice, of course, TCG collections are basically an addiction, especially opening booster packs.  Lastly, I am glad The Lost Glitches cards are on IMX, since I’ve bought and sold quite a few, the little to no gas fees in IMX are really nice and make everything smoother.  The 5th booster pack sale date is TBA, so keep your eyes peeled.

'The Lost Glitches' is the name of the project and game, but also their original NFT collection on the ETH mainnet.  The 10K collection minted in Aug. ‘21 was a pretty standard mint during the bull run, 10K total sold with varied traits, which will funnel into the game.  The collection sold out quickly and saw a rapid floor climb shortly after, having 1624 ETH total in current transaction volume. 

The main benefit behind the NFT collection is the ability to stake for $LOST token generation, with bonus multipliers for staking multiple Glitches.  It's important to note the team has confirmed staking will eventually sunset.  Additionally, each Glitch can claim a free Class NFT, which is another collection called the Deep Sky Network, this claim is available once per Glitch and you can check if it’s already been done on their website.  Holding a Class NFT will have in-game rewards like avatars, card backs, and titles according to an older Medium article, however, these benefits are subject to change, which I anticipate an update closer to the full launch of the game.  

Finally, each Glitch may be tethered to an in-game syndicate, allowing you to claim a Syndicate Leader NFT.  Each Leader NFT will grant in-game bonuses similar to the Class NFTs, but again, the exact benefits will be detailed near the full launch.  

The $LOST token is the utility token of the game's ecosystem.  It's still fair to remember that despite 'Utility', 1 $LOST = $LOST.  I do not recommend speculating on it, since it has an uncapped supply with multiple generation sources, meant to be used in-game only.  Currently, the only thing you can do with these tokens is purchase booster packs.  In the future, we can expect to be able to purchase many other things such as individual cards, characters, avatars, season passes, and more using $LOST.

### History and Future

The Lost Glitches project and Discord opened in August 2021, and the 10K collection minted during the same month. 

In late September they announced they were joining together with Honig Studios, a previously established indie studio in Berlin, makers of award-winning El Hijo.  The next couple of months were normal web3 community stuff with giveaways and other activities, as the game development had just started. The $LOST token went live Dec. ‘21, followed next month by staking and a comic drop.  The Class NFT collection launch and claiming went live April ‘22, which remains open for holders to claim at their leisure.  

Jumping back in time, I'd like to point out a particular discord announcement in Jan. ‘22, where their team, in short, claimed they weren’t going to be marketing the game until the time was right.

Meaning they would not be wasting any time or resources with artificial interest.  This is important to consider, especially since during the time countless other projects were just shouting over each other with nothing to show during the last bull run, this team had their head down low, working on the game sooner than most other projects, which later became a valuable lesson during the bear market.  They have always provided monthly updates on the game development but if you didn’t know about TLG at this point you likely weren’t going to for the reasons mentioned before.  

In May ‘22, they announced that Honig and The Lost Glitches would be merging to create a new studio called Mimunga Gaming and opening a new office in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Fast forward to Dec’ 22, the “Memories Set” of the cards is ready to start rolling out, and ImmutableX became the chosen blockchain for this. The genesis Memories set is broken into 6 drops of 50 cards and currently, 4 of the 6 booster pack openings have occurred.  Each of those booster pack mints has included small marketing campaigns with $LOST giveaways, which can be used to purchase packs. 

Fast forwarding through the booster pack drops, the closed alpha testing opened up June 7th ‘23 to chosen community members.  This phase was very basic, with prebuilt decks and not hosted on any game platform.  

This brings us to the current news for TLG and Season 0 of the “limited” alpha that is on the Epic Game Store.

The Lost Glitches is an absolute sleeper pick in the web3 space, the team has built a fun streamlined TCG, with well thought out mechanics and a clear understanding of this type of game.  Development has progressed without the usual web3 marketing, which often includes way too many tweets, and announcements of frivolous partnerships.  I fully believe it is worth it to keep a close eye on The Lost Glitches, especially when it is fully launched early next year.
