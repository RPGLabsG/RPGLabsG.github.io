### Quick Summary

Don’t have 10-15 minutes to learn all about The Lost Glitches?  Then this paragraph is for you. If you do have the time, however, feel free to skip to the intro.  

The Lost Glitches is an upcoming Web3 trading card game (TCG) and role-playing game, being developed by Mimunga Gaming.  It’s cyberpunk-themed both in art and lore, with fantastic-looking cards and UI.  The game just entered its limited alpha on the Epic Games Store and spots are, as implied, limited.

The Lost Glitches has a 10K NFT Collection on Ethereum with utility and perks for the game, which are separate from their cards (also NFTs) that can be found on ImmutableX.  This game is currently a bit of sleeper since their team has deliberately avoided the normal web3 drip-feed marketing, but you’ll likely be seeing plenty of news as they begin marketing near full-launch.

### What is The Lost Glitches?

The Lost Glitches is a Web3 trading card and role-playing game, being developed by Mimunga Gaming, currently available on the Epic Game Store in its limited alpha.   

The game takes place within the Deep Sky Network.  A future post-apocalyptic digital existence where there’s not enough memory to go around and you must fight for your memories.  There’s not much lore for the game yet but the idea certainly hooks you in.  

The game was originally funded by its 10K NFT collection sale, with these NFTs providing utility and perks for the full game release sometime next year.  The cards are also NFTs and have been slowly rolling out through booster pack sales.  

The limited alpha or Season 0 as it is referred to, features deck building and a ranked leaderboard with some really juicy rewards for the top players, including physical cards.  We’ll be diving into how to get access to the alpha, what you can expect from the gameplay, and some history of the project.

### How To Get Started?

The Lost Glitches has moved into their “limited alpha”, which is only on the Epic Game Store.  So first things first, if you don’t have an Epic Games account yet, you will need to go to their website, create an account, and download the Epic Games launcher.  Epic Games has been quickly onboarding Web3 games and frequently gives away high-quality free games on their application, so it is a good idea to keep it on your PC regardless.
