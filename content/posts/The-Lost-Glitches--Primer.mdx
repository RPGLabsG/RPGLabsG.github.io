### Quick Summary

Don’t have 10-15 minutes to learn all about The Lost Glitches?  Then this paragraph is for you. If you do have the time, however, feel free to skip to the intro.  

The Lost Glitches is an upcoming Web3 trading card game (TCG) and role-playing game, being developed by Mimunga Gaming.  It’s cyberpunk-themed both in art and lore, with fantastic-looking cards and UI.  The game just entered its limited alpha on the Epic Games Store and spots are, as implied, limited.

The Lost Glitches has a 10K NFT Collection on Ethereum with utility and perks for the game, which separate from their cards (also NFTs) that can be found on ImmutableX.  This game is currently a bit of sleeper, since their team has deliberately avoided the normal web3 drip-feed marketing, but you’ll likely be seeing plenty of news as they begin marketing near full-launch.
