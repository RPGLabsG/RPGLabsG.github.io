The Year of The Kingdom: 2024

A full year ago when we celebrated the start of 2023, The Kingdom’s team was a quarter of its current size, and we had no idea what the journey ahead of us would bring. Looking back at our progress over this last year, it is clear that we are truly coming into our own and the pace and quality of production has increased dramatically as the team grew and learned.

We are incredibly proud and grateful for all the love and hard work that the team and community poured into The Kingdom. We’ve never been better positioned to bring our vision of a living RPG world for our gaming community to life, and invite you to take a look at where we’ve been, and our plans for the future.
