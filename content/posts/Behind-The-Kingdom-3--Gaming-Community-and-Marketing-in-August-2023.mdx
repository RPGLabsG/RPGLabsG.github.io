### Summary:

The Front of House team has been incredibly busy this last month preparing for our Avatar Configurator Launch marketing push, as well as ensuring that you, the community, always have a gaming opportunity to look forward to– be it a tournament, a stream, strategic content, or playtests.

You won’t have to take my word for it though, the initiatives and opportunities that we will be bringing to you over the next month are a testament to their hard work.

### Gaming:

* Ozone, Spaceman, and Jona began their Twitch streaming schedule, offering engaging content to watch most nights of the week. Make sure you [follow us on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/thekingdomworld), here, and show some love to [Ozone ](https://www.twitch.tv/ozonefreerun)& [Jona’s ](https://www.twitch.tv/jonakinho)personal channels as well.
* Ozone has been writing weekly gaming blogs, exploring the best Web3 games through a variety of formats, from primers to deep dives. You can check out the first couple on the blog, and can expect many more to drop over the coming weeks, including The Bornless, Dead Drop, and BigTime.
* Lucas & Ozone put their heads together and have crafted some exciting competitive opportunities as well, with bigger prize pools than ever. Make sure to keep your eyes peeled for more news on this!

### Marketing:

* Alex has created a behemoth of a marketing plan, covering everything from social media strategies, content schedules, and giveaways. 
* Our blog was released, ensuring our community has a convenient place to access all of the information about The Kingdom and the games it plays, with the added benefit of increasing our SEO.
* We have created a new version of our pitch deck, which is now polished and ready to be used in our expanded outreach efforts. We have already had some awesome successes in this area, which we can’t wait to share with you!

### Closing Thoughts:

At the risk of sounding like a broken record, we just want to reiterate how important the community is to everything that we do here in The Kingdom. There is an inherent power to gaming, and as we stand at the cusp of a gaming revolution, having a thriving community, full of gamers who’s skill & opinions you trust, will be the #1 most valuable thing that a gamer can be a part of. If this is your vision as well, then we think you’ll be very happy with the utility, decision making power, and quality of resources that we plan on bringing to you in the coming months, spearheaded by our FoH team.

You’ll get your first taste of that later today when we release our Community Rewards Quest System!
