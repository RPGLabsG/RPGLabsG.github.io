What to Expect
--------------

In our riddles, you will experience a three-part story, guiding the journey of Alric as he discovers the secrets behind some of the most powerful groups of Aesor. The choices that you make will change the course of history on Aesor in big ways.

Each of the three parts is divided into a number of individual steps. Some can only be completed after a certain amount of time has passed, and others will be a race to complete. This week you will have access to the first of the three parts, and all of the prizes and glory which its completion has to offer!

## What Makes The Kingdoms’ Riddles Different?

Throughout the story you will encounter carefully crafted art and lore from our very own Creative Team, as well as custom riddle mechanics from Seize, the brilliant mind behind Neo Tokyo’s famous riddles. It is designed to be an immersive experience, with steps that have been fully fictionalized so that the clues can be hidden in plain sight throughout the paintings and text.

Since you’ll be able to access the riddles through our application, we were able to include plenty of quality of life updates that you might not be familiar with in other riddles. For instance, we won’t slow you down by checking for capitalization or spaces, and you won’t have to wait to know whether your guesses are correct or not.

In The Kingdom, your decisions matter. This is a mindset we try to incorporate into everything we build, be it our Avatar Configurator, our Social RPG, or even our riddles. Our Lore team has put some major decisions on the line, the consequences of which will be far reaching. At the end of each of the three arcs you will be able to vote on something related to the story. Your decision will affect not only the next riddles, but also how the world of Aesor will look at the start of our Social RPG.

## Prizes 

We wanted to strike a balance between properly rewarding the fastest puzzle solvers, while also encouraging everyone to participate, regardless of skill level. One way we have accomplished this is to ensure a range of prizes.

### Completion Prizes

For this first riddle arc, the first three to reach the end will receive the Grand Prize:

* 1x Tear of Aedehas (more info below)
* 1x Riddle Grand Master title
* 1x Chainmail chest piece 

All others who make it to the end will receive:

* 1x Riddle Master title
* 1x Chainmail chest piece

### Participation Prizes

Furthermore, the first 10 to solve each step will receive:

* 2 Community Rewards points
* 2% Avatar Mint discount

All others will receive:

* 1 Community Reward point
* 1% Avatar Mind discount

### Further Prizing Details

All points and discounts will be viewable in your Kingdom application profile within 24 hours of them being earned.

For Titles, Armor, and Tears of Aedehas, you will receive an email verifying your prizes. These prizes will be claimable once you have created an Avatar, granting you access to a Player Vault and Avatar Inventory.

### Tears of Aedehas

The rarest weapons and armor in The Kingdom’s ecosystem exist as 1 of 1 Mythical Armaments, each with its own unique and in-depth backstory. In order to craft these armaments in our Social RPG, you will need a Tear of Aedehas as a crafting component.

In The Kingdom, weapons and armor are what make the rarest Avatars, so if you want to prove your skill and dedication, these limited opportunities to start preparing your path to the Mythical Armaments are not to be missed.

Difficulty & Pacing
-------------------

Another way in which we have attempted to find the balance between providing an experience that is fun for all experience levels, while still challenging those with the most experience, is by varying the difficulty and pacing of the riddles.

Each of the three parts will follow a different format, and each step varies in difficulty.

For this first part, we have started it off relatively easy. You might solve the first step quickly, if you do, perhaps see if any of your fellow Aesar need a helping hand. Afterall, community and teamwork are important in The Kingdom.

For the first handful of steps, you’ll have to wait 24 hours between the start of each step before moving to the next. This ensures an even playing field until everyone has their footing, and encourages participants to work together as the riddles slowly increase in complexity. Remember, even in these steps, the first ten to finish will receive double rewards.

Eventually, the 24 hour waiting periods will be lifted, and the true race for the Tears of Aedehas begins!

For the second and third parts, which will be announced at a later date, there is no promise that any such training wheels will stay on ;)
